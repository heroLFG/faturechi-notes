uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Creation and Last Thursdayism</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>So, I got into a whole long discussion with several people about the Jewish view of Creation and science. I wanted to write an explanation of my beliefs as an explanation of traditional Jewish beliefs. Now, I am not saying that my explanation is how every traditional Jew would explain their beliefs. I am saying that what I explain is squarely within the confines of Orthodox Jewish belief and not a post hoc rationalization to try to combine religion with science.

First, I think it is important to point out that there needs not be a real conflict between the Jewish idea that the world is 5,780 years old and the scientific belief that the Big Bang took place however many millions or billions or trillions of years you like. I will quote Rashi’s commentary on the very first word of the Torah on Genesis 1:1 sub verbo Bereshit.

“This verse cries out to be explained...and the verse did not come to teach the order of Creation saying what came first...this verse is obviously missing a word since you have verses which speak briefly leaving out a detail...If you do want to explain it literally, you are contradicting yourself...so you are forced to admit that the Bible is not teaching what came earlier in the order of Creation at all.”

Look there for all the various proofs he gives in detail. This was written a thousand years ago, before any question of scientific dating was in anyone’s mind at all. The words of Rashi are clearly acceptable to all of Judaism and anyone who wishes to bind their fortunes with one of the greatest Sages is clearly within their right to do so.

My point, however, was not to simply allow people an “excuse” to believe whatever they like. Judaism has a calendar and according to our traditional calendar we count 5,780 years from Creation. Again, there are plenty of people who will talk about what exactly Creation means and many will hang their hats on the traditional explanation of the verse Psalm 90:4 that reads “For in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday that has passed, like a watch of the night.”

This is the eternal problem of people who try to reconcile religion with science. They usually make a mess of both by adulterating their religion and their science, failing fall short of the value provided by each.

What does Judaism not only allow you to believe, but what does Judaism teach, about Creation?

I believe, based solely on the teachings of Judaism without any adulteration from any other source whatsoever, that Judaism has believed in what is called derisively Last Thursdayism or more formally the Omphalos Hypothesis. (Rabbi Dr. Dovid Gottlieb, one of my teachers at Ohr Somayach, also says the same thing.)

The fact is that empiricism cannot prove that the world was not created Last Thursday. Such a belief, while certainly not required by empiricism, is not refuted by empiricism. Which is all the deference that Judaism gives to empiricism, as explained at length by Rabbi Soloveichik in Halakhic Man specifically in Note 4.

The Talmud makes clear in Rosh Hashanah 11a and 27b that everything “נבראו לצביונן” that is they were created in their fullness. That is to say that Adam was created a fully formed human, the trees were created with fruit and that the animals appeared to be older than they really were. This idea is at least 1500 years old. It is not a rationalization created to reconcile Judaism with science.

There are those who object to this idea as dishonest. Why would G-d, the One True G-d, do such a thing? Why would He lie to us? Why the deception?

Such a question fundamentally misunderstands how Judaism views Creation and G-d. G-d is invisible! The world, all of Creation, hides G-d from us. That is one of the fundamental messages of Judaism. Mysticism literally refers to the study of what is “concealed.” To say that Creation is the concealment of G-d is a basic tenet of Judaism and Jewish mysticism.

Which is why religiously the belief that the world is 5,780 years old is fundamental to Judaism. Which is why this idea, despite not being the best “band-aid” to reconcile science with Judaism, is what I believe is the Jewish belief and is True.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 29, 2020, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">The Metric Tensor and the Kabbalah</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Introduction

Due to the severe clash we have seen over the years between people who consider themselves to be scientists and people who consider themselves to be theologians, we have an intense derangement of both fields. I am not going to describe this derangement in detail since it has been discussed at length in many places. I simply want to include several words of caution so that this article should not become some sort of stumbling block.

Epistemology is the study of how we know things. There are many methods to gain knowledge. The method we most often claim to rely upon is an epistemology based on empiricism and reason. The study of the philosophy of science is rich and deserves independent study. A different method we rely upon is some form of religious revelation. Many people have various preferences for the interaction between these two methods. The intellectual battle has been fierce and the greatest casualty has been the derangement of both into some bulwark against the other.

This article is not an exercise in epistemology. It is an exercise in comparison. Whether you view scientific knowledge as the only valid epistemology, invalid itself, complementary to revelation or antagonistic is completely irrelevant here. This article is a comparison of the results of the methods. I am no physicist and I make no claim whatsoever to contributing any knowledge at all to physics. What discussion of physics I include is merely an expression of the knowledge that has already been obtained and agreed upon by physicists. If you have any question or quarrel with the physics, take it up with the physicists. To the extent that anything I say here about physics contradicts physics as understood by orthodox physicists, I apologize and recant.

Similarly, I am no Kabbalist. I am merely setting out Kabbalistic concepts as have been taught to me from various sources. There is no attempt, Heaven forbid, at restructuring the Kabbalah to fit any model of physics whatsoever. To the extent that anything I say here about the Kabbalah contradicts the teachings of the Arizal, his students, the Baal Shem Tov, or his students; I repent and pray forgiveness.

I would illustrate what this article attempts with two examples of a similar, yet less complicated, exercise. Biologists teach us that every cell in the human body, with few exceptions, includes a genetic code which describes us each as a person. Similarly, the Kabbalists teach that every part of a human is imbued with the essence of that human in a uniform manner. While the coincidence of these two teachings is of interest, there is no implication that either the biological or the Kabbalistic understanding in either case should pervert the other. If certain cells do not have the genetic code, that has no implications on the Kabbalistic understanding. Similarly, if the Kabbalistic understanding of some part of the human should imply that the essence would not be imbued in the same way as the rest, that has no implications for the biologist.

In a much similar manner, the Kabbalists teach about two forms of lights which emanate from the Infinite Blessed One. One light is a transcendent and encompassing light which does not interact with this world. The other is an immanent and pervasive light which imparts its unique energy to all that are able to receive it. Physicists teach us that some radiation is similarly in the background and does not interact with the material world we perceive easily. Other forms of radiation does interact in certain ways allowing us to feel its warmth or see its effects. It would be foolish to pervert one understanding with the other. Yet it is a useful exercise to the human to understand aspects of each by way of analogy.

Analogies fail where they fail. Our understanding of science fails where it fails. Our understanding of revelation fails where it fails. As the Tikkunei Zohar teaches, “no thought can grasp You.”

This interaction is treated at length in many other forms by many wise people. I simply warn against the particular danger that Rabbi Soloveitchik notes in his masterpiece Halakhic Man. “The individual who frees himself from the rational principle and who casts off the yoke of objective thought will in the end turn destructive and lay waste the entire created order.”

The Metric Tensor

“In general relativity, the metric tensor...is the fundamental object of study... It captures all the geometric and causal structure of spacetime, being used to define notions such as time, distance, volume, curvature, angle, and separation of the future and the past.” -Metric tensor (general relativity) entry from Wikipedia

Physicists teach us that we live in a world which has four fundamental dimensions. The first of these dimensions is time, which has its own unique status signified by a metric signature that defines it as timelike. We often use the variable t to signify the measure of time. There are three dimensions which we identify with the three dimensions of solids which similarly have a metric signature that defines them as spacelike. The first dimension, usually denoted by x, allows us to measure along a line. A second dimension, usually denoted by y, allows this line to be iterated into a plane. A third dimension, usually denoted z, allows us to depict the essential model of the universe most simply understood in our imagination with Euclidean geometry.

This model of what is called spacetime in four dimensions is the intuitively simple understanding of our physical reality as described by the scientific method and human reason. Only in modern times have physicists started to explain a far more complex feature of spacetime, which is its “curvature.”

This curvature exists because the relationship between the dimensions varies. So to understand the exact nature of any event in spacetime, we need more than just the values of t, x, y and z. We also need to measure the relationship of t, x, y and z to each other. The metric can be written as a 4 × 4 symmetric matrix. 

The diagonal of the matrix is made up of the measure of the four dimensions we described. The values above and below the diagonal describe the relationship between those values. This matrix is symmetrical, so the value of g for 01 and 10 are the same. It is the measure of the relationship between t and x.

Because of the symmetry, the matrix has 16 values but only 10 degrees of freedom. Since the six values above the diagonal describe the same relationship as the values below the diagonal, there are only 10 independent coefficients. Six of the 16 coefficients, thus double up.

The Chain of Causation

The Kabbalah describes Creation in a manner which appears to reflect similar ideas. There is a Seder Hishtalshelut, meaning a Chain of Causation, that links between certain spiritual realities and the physical world we encounter in material form. The first manifestation of the first glimmer of spiritual Emanation into Creation is called the “World” or Dimension of Atzilut. Atzilut can be analogized as timelike in that it still has only the positive momentum of pure spirituality.

A qualitative difference exists between Atzilut and the three Worlds below it. The Worlds of Beriah (Creation), Yetzirah (Formation) and A’asiyah (Action) are fundamentally different in that they are created. This is where Creation takes place. This is where material gains its capacity to be spacelike. Thus they may be analogized to the Dimensions of space, progressively allowing more concrete manifestations of materialism until a three dimensional world of Action becomes possible.

In a manner that may be analogized to the Metric Tensor, there exists a Tree of Life in each of these Worlds. It can also be explained as ten Attributes that describe “degrees of freedom” that help define all that exists.  The first Attribute could be considered Keter Malchut, which could be analogized as a measure of time. As we say in prayer, “G-d is King. G-d was King. G-d will be King forever and ever.”

The three intellectual faculties could be and are often analogized to the measurement of space. Chochmah is defined as koach mah or the flashpoint of unexplicated inspiration. It is a single point. Binah builds upon that inspiration, giving it breadth. It is analogized to a river. Da’at gives full form to thoughts. These may be analogized to the measures of the three spacial dimensions x, y and z.

Along with Malchut, the other 6 Attributes are referred to as “doubles.” There are the first set of Chesed, Gevurah and Tiferet. These may be analogized to the relationship between the three spacial dimensions. Chesed describes that which can be easily understood, thus like a straightforward relationship between the first and second spacial dimension. Gevurah represents a less direct relationship, possibly the relationship between the first and third spacial dimensions. Tiferet represents the Beauty of many colors, possibly a relationship between the second and third spacial dimensions.

The second set of three Attributes consists of Netzach, Hod and Yesod. It is possible that these Attributes can be analogized to the relationship between time and each spacial dimension. In a similar manner to the first set, Netzach may be a straightforward relationship between time and the first dimension. Hod may be the relationship of time to the more derivative second dimension. Yesod may represent a relationship between time and the fullness of the third spacial dimension.

Six is not Seven and not Eight

Sefer Yetzirah explains in Chapter 4 the seven “doubles.” It mentions “beged kaperet” which consists of seven letters that in Hebrew consist of doubles. These letters take a “dagesh kal” which slightly changes how they are pronounced. Curiously, the description of Sefer Yetzirah is actually not consonant with the current rules of Hebrew grammar. There are six letters in “beged kefet” which does not include the letter resh as stated.

We are taught they are “Seven, not six. Seven, not eight.”

Beged kefet can be read “clothing of restraint.” As the Aramaic in Daniel chapter 3 speaks of binding using the letters kaf, peh and tav a total of four times. Beged kaperet can be read “clothing of atonement.” As the Hebrew in Exodus chapter 25 speaks of the golden cover of the Ark as a “kaporet” seven times. Could it be that Malchut does not show its nature as a double because we are restrained and once we have atoned, the Melech Moshiach shall be revealed?

The Arizal taught that during the Shattering of the Vessels, six of the Attributes broke. Malchut was cracked, but did not shatter. These are the seven doubles. Will the cracks in the vessel of Malchut be rectified? When that happens will the resh be as described in Sefer Yetzirah, taking a dagesh kal? The doubles are seven, they are not six.

Malchut, however, exists in a superstate unlike any of the other Attributes. It is Keter Malchut, both the top and the bottom at the same time. The Malchut of each World manifests as the Keter of World below it. The doubles are seven, they are not eight.

It seems to me that the similarities may be helpful to those who study such things in seeing the Light a tiny bit more clearly.</div><div><a href="photos_and_videos/your_posts/93859563_2693561997597217_5986148073670180864_n_2693561994263884.jpg"><img src="photos_and_videos/your_posts/93859563_2693561997597217_5986148073670180864_n_2693561994263884.jpg" class="_2yuc _3-96" /></a></div><div class="_2pic"><table class="uiGrid _51mz" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr class="_51mx"><td class="_51m- pas"><div><a href="photos_and_videos/your_posts/93845496_2693733880913362_4017290882855206912_n_2693733877580029.jpg"><img src="photos_and_videos/your_posts/93845496_2693733880913362_4017290882855206912_n_2693733877580029.jpg" class="_2yuc _3-96" /></a></div></td><td class="_51m- pas"><div><a href="photos_and_videos/your_posts/92952816_2693758310910919_6729967496587116544_n_2693758307577586.jpg"><img src="photos_and_videos/your_posts/92952816_2693758310910919_6729967496587116544_n_2693758307577586.jpg" class="_2yuc _3-96" /></a><div class="_3-95">The Tree of Life showing the superposition of Keter and Malchut</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 18, 2020, 9:12 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Towards a reasonable economic discourse</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>On Sunday, I attended the modern equivalent of the “salons” that Ayn Rand made popular. A bunch of smart people had gotten together to discuss topics of interest.

As is usual today, we fell into well-worn ruts of entrenched positions. It was obvious who the Gary Johnson voters were and who the Bernie Sanders voters were. I could have written the script before I arrived. I could identify the cars of each member by their bumper stickers. It was in turns infuriating and boring to rehash the same ideas over and over again.

Then Eric Weinstein showed up and threw a bomb which completely changed the landscape of the discussion for me. He stopped making the exact same arguments that we are used to talking about. He wrote a new script for a conversation I had never heard before.

Let’s talk about the economy in ways that presume you already know basic economics. Let’s assume you are already aware of all the standard arguments regarding public goods. Now explode the definition matrix by including new possibilities of anti-rivalry and inexhaustibility. Digital goods are not simply public goods, they are far more problematic than public goods. Our old concepts of economics simply fail to describe them at all.

Take the classic examples we use to describe rivalry, excludibility and exhaustion. Fish in a river approach not being rivalrous and excludable, but not really. We realize that the real life situation falls far short. Fisheries also don’t constitute a huge part of our economy in terms of gross domestic product. The content of books did to some extent approach being non-rivalrous, but again imperfectly. We didn’t used to have goods that could ever be considered truly non-rivalrous, much less anti-rivalrous. Facebook is anti-rivalrous. Not only does my use of Facebook not preclude your use, your non-use precludes my use. These goods are not merely part of our economy, they are taking over our economy.

Yes, to some extent we have discussed network effects. What we have not discussed is that our current systems no longer work towards our stated goal. We want an economic system that rewards the production of wealth, maximizes the value of the consumption of wealth and penalizes the destruction of wealth.

When you speak of an anti-rivalrous good, it is the act of consumption which produces wealth! I don’t know if I can adequately convey how this turns our economics on its head. Consuming a product creates wealth. Imagine every time you ate your cake, you ended up with two cakes. Yes, you can have your cake and eat it too. If you are really nice, you can eat your cake so someone else can have a magically multiplying cake. Should we start paying you to eat cake?

An economic system should reward people for producing wealth. A person who shares their private health information with medical researchers is producing wealth. This is very valuable information, much more valuable than we truly acknowledge. We want to incentivize this behavior, yet our current system never contemplates doing so. At best we allow people to create wealth without charging them for the privilege. How is that a sensible system?

These are not the same old questions reframed. We are not repackaging Marx or Smith, we are not even repackaging Kruger and Kaplan. We are talking about new behaviors which require new incentive structures to maximize wealth production. We have to take into consideration that these are not trivial matters. We are talking about very large sectors of our economy behaving in ways that our current models do not contemplate.

What does it mean to have a free market in a good that is truly inexhaustible? What does it mean to try to have an unregulated market in goods that are essentially inexcludable? Do we really want to use government force (as we are) to stop people from using an anti-rivalrous good? The network effect is not merely another externality or market failure to be considered along with the materialist dialectic. 

If we want to discuss economics today, we actually have real topics to discuss instead of rehashing the same ideas that Ayn Rand would have discussed before any of us were born. I have had those conversations. I had them 30 years ago and I see no reason to have them again.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Feb 19, 2020, 4:52 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">A Religious Revival</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I believe the discussions regarding religion in the Intellectual Dark Web are the most pertinent questions of our times. There are several questions that have been addressed by Jordan Peterson, Bret Weinstein, Eric Weinstein, Douglas Murray, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Ben Shapiro and probably every putative member at various times.

Two seminal questions present themselves. First and foremost is the question of the evolutionary fitness and relevance of religion to human society as best presented by the discussion between Bret and Dawkins in Chicago. As faulty as the video of the event is, I still believe it is possibly the most relevant discussion of its time possibly in my entire lifetime.

To summarize, Bret presents the idea that religion is a manifestation of the extended phenotype of human beings. As opposed to the belief espoused by Dawkins that religion is self-replicating, Bret presents the idea that the capacity for religious belief is itself an adaptation which our biology would jettison given the load it presents to fitness. Therefore it is necessary to conclude that religiosity has adaptive value to the human being.

While the debates between Peterson and Harris were interesting, I found the roles of the moderators to be even more salient. Murray asks possibly the most important question, if you accept Bret’s proposition: Can the mere pretension to religious belief adequately capture the benefits of religion?

I believe the answer is clear and resounding. No. Of course, it cannot. Which is why the various attempts by people like Peterson and the Weinsteins are doomed to fail. You cannot create a more adaptive religion. You must adopt the best adapted religion.

Here, I must incorporate by reference three works in their entirety. First is Mark Twain’s essay Concerning the Jews. 

To conclude. - If the statistics are right, the Jews constitute but one per cent. of the human race. It suggests a nebulous dim puff of star-dust lost in the blaze of the Milky Way. Properly the Jew ought hardly to be heard of; but he is heard of, has always been heard of. He is as prominent on the planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk. His contributions to the world&#039;s list of great names in literature, science, art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are also away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers.


He has made a marvellous fight in this world, in all the ages; and has done it with his hands tied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused for it. The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek and the Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and they are gone; other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished.


The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind. All things are mortal but the Jew; all other forces pass, but he remains. What is the secret of his immortality?

Second is Rabbi J.B. Soloveichik’s modern restatement of the philosophical core of Judaism, Halakhic Man. I will briefly abridge an integral part from Note 4.

This ideology is partially embedded in the most ancient strata of Christianity... And that which appears in the sermons of these preachers in a primitive, garbled form, at times interwoven with a childish naivete and superficial belief, is refined and purified in the furnace of popular “philosophy” and “theology” and becomes transformed into a universal religious ideology ... Typical of this attitude is the Christian Science movement.


It would appear to me that there is no need to explain the self-evident falsity of this ideology. First, the entire Romantic aspiration to escape from the domain of knowledge, the rebellion against the authority of objective, scientific cognition ... have brought complete chaos and human depravity to the world. And let the events of the present era be proof! The individual who frees himself from the rational principle and who casts off the yoke of objective thought will in the end turn destructive and lay waste the entire created order...


And, second, this ideology is intrinsically false and deceptive. That religious consciousness in man’s experience which is most profound and most elevated, which penetrates to the very depths and ascends to the very heights, is not that simple and comfortable. On the contrary, it is exceptionally complex, rigorous, and tortuous. Where you find its complexity, there you find its greatness. The religious experience, from beginning to end, is antinomic and antithetic. ... It is a condition of spiritual crisis, of psychic ascent and descent, of contradiction arising from affirmation and negation, self-abnegation and self-appreciation. The ideas of temporality and eternity, knowledge and choice (necessity and freedom), love and fear (the yearning for G-d and the flight from His glorious splendor), incredible, overbold daring, and an extreme sense of humility, transcendence and G-d’s closeness, the profane and holy, etc., etc., struggle within his religious consciousness, wrestle and grapple with each other. This one ascends and this descends, this falls and this rises...

For the path that eventually will lead to the “green pastures” and to the “still waters” is not the royal road, but a narrow, twisting footway that threads its course along the steep mountain slope, as the terrible abyss yawns at the the travelers feet...
 
The pangs of searching and groping, the tortures of spiritual crises and exhausting treks of the soul purify and sanctify man, cleanse his thoughts, and purge them of the husks of superficiality and the dross of vulgarity. Out of these torments there emerges a new understanding of the world, a powerful spiritual enthusiasm that shakes the very foundations of man’s existence. He arises from the agonies, purged and refined, possessed of a pure heart and new spirit. “It is a time of agony unto Jacob, but out of it shall he be saved” (Jer. 30:7) - i.e. from out of the very midst of the agony itself he will attain eternal salvation and redemption. The spiritual stature and countenance of the man of G-d are chiseled and formed by the pangs of redemption themselves.

Third is Maimonides’s prophetic vision of the Redemption in The Laws of Kings and Wars Chapter 11, specifically his conclusion of Halacha 4 which was completed in the year 1180 of the Common Era.

Nevertheless, the intent of the Creator of the world is not within the power of man to comprehend, for His ways are not our ways, nor are His thoughts, our thoughts. Ultimately, all the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth and that Ishmaelite who arose after him will only serve to prepare the way for Mashiach&#039;s coming and the improvement of the entire world, motivating the nations to serve G-d together as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: &#039;I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.&#039;


How will this come about? The entire world has already become filled with the mention of Mashiach, Torah, and mitzvot. These matters have been spread to the furthermost islands to many stubborn-hearted nations. They discuss these matters and the mitzvot of the Torah, saying: &#039;These mitzvot were true, but were already negated in the present age and are not applicable for all time.&#039;


Others say: &#039;Implied in the mitzvot are hidden concepts that can not be understood simply. The Mashiach has already come and revealed those hidden truths.&#039;

When the true Messianic king will arise and prove successful, his position becoming exalted and uplifted, they will all return and realize that their ancestors endowed them with a false heritage and their prophets and ancestors caused them to err.

Rather than attempt to create gold ex nihilo, is it not time for the alchemists to come together and compare notes on how to best trasmute matter? Can we not, with a sincere belief in the Messianic vision that has already captured human civilization from all four corners of the Earth, recognize the One Truth and One G-d?

If we are to believe in the science of evolution, should we not also seek the religion of evolution? As it is written in Exodus 7:10-12:

[Thereupon,] Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they did so, as the Lord had commanded; Aaron cast his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.


[Then,] Pharaoh too summoned the wise men and the magicians, and the necromancers of Egypt also did likewise with their magic.


Each one of them cast down his staff, and they became serpents; but Aaron&#039;s staff swallowed their staffs.

Let us not conjure neither a golem from completely inanimate matter nor splice together dead parts to create a new monster like Dr. Frankenstein. We should pick up the magic staff that consumed all other staffs.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Feb 16, 2020, 1:22 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Halakhic Man</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>From Halakhic Man by Rabbi J. B. Soloveichik, Note 4.

Even though Kierkegaard disagreed with Hegel’s philosophy from beginning to end and made it the object of his fierce, stinging attacks, he, nevertheless, accepted from him the dialectic principle (with many significant changes, to be sure). And this concept of the dialectic, which he and Karl Barth introduced into the analysis of the unfolding of the religious consciousness, and this view concerning the antinomic structure of religious experience, which was revised and refined by Rudolf Otto in his book, The Idea of the Holy , give the lie to the position that is prevalent nowadays in religious circles, whether Protestant groups or in American Reform and Conservative Judaism, that the religious experience is of a very simple nature - that is, devoid of spiritual tortuousness present in the secular cultural consciousness, of psychic upheavals, and of the pangs and torments that are inextricably connected with the developments and refinements of man’s spiritual personality. This popular ideology contends that the religious experience is tranquil and neatly ordered, tender and delicate; it is an enchanted stream for embittered souls and still waters for troubled spirits. The person “who comes in from the field, weary” (Gen. 25:29), from the battlefield and campaigns of life, from the secular domain which is filled with doubts and fears, contradictions and refutations, clings to religious as does a baby to its mother and finds in her lap “a shelter for his head, the nest of his forsaken prayers” [H. N. Bialik, “Hakhnisini tahat kenafekh”] and there is comforted for his disappointments and tribulations. This ideology is partially embedded in the most ancient strata of Christianity, partially rooted in modern pragmatic philosophy; but mainly it stems from practical-utilitarian considerations. The advocates of religion wish to exploit the rebellious impulse against knowledge which surges from time to time in the soul of the man of culture, the yearning to be freed from the bonds of culture, that daughter of knowledge, which weighs heavy on man with its questions, doubts, and problems, and the desire to escape from the turbulence of life to a magical, still, and quiet island and there to devote oneself to the ideal of naturalness and vitality. This Rousseauean ideology left its stamp on the entire Romantic movement from the beginning of its growth until its final (tragic!) manifestations in the consciousness of contemporary man. Therefore, the representatives of religious communities are inclined to portray religion, in a wealth of colors that dazzle the eye, as a poetic Arcadia, a realm of simplicity, wholeness, and tranquility. Most of the sermons of revivalists are divided in equal measures between depicting the terrors of hellfire and describing the utopian tranquility that religion can bestow upon man. And that which appears in the sermons of these preachers in a primitive, garbled form, at times interwoven with a childish naivete and superficial belief, is refined and purified in the furnace of popular “philosophy” and “theology” and becomes transformed into a universal religious ideology which proclaims: If you wish to acquire tranquility without paying the price of spiritual agonies, turn unto religion! If you wish to achieve a fine psychic equilibrium without having to first undergo a slow, gradual personal development, turn unto religion. And if you wish to achieve an instant spiritual wholeness and simplicity that needs not be forged out of the struggles and torments of consciousness, turn unto religion! “Get thee out of thy country,” which is filled anxiety, anguish and tension, “and from thy birthplace.” which is so frenzied, raging, and stormy, “to the land” that is enveloped by the stillness of peace and tranquility, to the Arcadia wherein religion reigns supreme. The leap from the secular world to the religious world could not be simpler and easier. There is no need for a process of transition with all its torments and upheavals. A person can acquire spiritual tranquility in a single moment. Typical of this attitude is the Christian Science movement.

It would appear to me that there is no need to explain the self-evident falsity of this ideology. First, the entire Romantic aspiration to escape from the domain of knowledge, the rebellion against the authority of objective, scientific cognition which has found its expression in the biologistic philosophies of Bergson, Nietzsche, Spengler, Klages, and their followers and in the phenomenological, existential, and antiscientific school of Heidegger and his coterie, and from the midsts of which there arose in various forms the sanctification of vitality and intuition, the veneration of instinct, the desire for power, the glorification of the emotional-affective life and the flowing, surging stream of subjectivity, the lavishing of extravagant praise on the Faustian type and the Dionysian personality, etc., etc., have brought complete chaos and human depravity to the world. And let the events of the present era be proof! The individual who frees himself from the rational principle and who casts off the yoke of objective thought will in the end turn destructive and lay waste the entire created order. Therefore, it is preferable that religion should ally itself with the forces of clear, logical cognition, as uniquely exemplified in the scientific method, even at times the two might clash with one another, rather than pledge its troth to beclouded, mysterious ideologies that grope in the dark corners of existence, unaided by the shining light of objective knowledge, and believe that they have penetrated to the secret core of the world.

And, second, this ideology is intrinsically false and deceptive. That religious consciousness in man’s experience which is most profound and most elevated, which penetrates to the very depths and ascends to the very heights, is not that simple and comfortable. On the contrary, it is exceptionally complex, rigorous, and tortuous. Where you find its complexity, there you find its greatness. The religious experience, from beginning to end, is antinomic and antithetic. The consciousness of homo religiosus flings bitter accusations against itself and immediately is filled with regret, judges its desires and yearnings with excessive severity, and at the same time steeps itself in them, casts derogatory aspersions on its own attributes, flails away at them, but also subjugates itself to them. It is a condition of spiritual crisis, of psychic ascent and descent, of contradiction arising from affirmation and negation, self-abnegation and self-appreciation. The ideas of temporality and eternity, knowledge and choice (necessity and freedom), love and fear (the yearning for G-d and the flight from His glorious splendor), incredible, overbold daring, and an extreme sense of humility, transcendence and G-d’s closeness, the profane and holy, etc., etc., struggle within his religious consciousness, wrestle and grapple with each other. This one ascends and this descends, this falls and this rises.

Religion is not, at the outset, a refuge of grace and mercy for the despondent and desperate, an enchanted stream for crushed spirits, but a raging, clamorous torrent of man’s consciousness with all its crises, pangs, and torments. Yes, it is true that during the third Shabbat meal at dusk, as the day of rest declines and man’s soul yearns for its Creator and is afraid to depart from that realm of holiness whose name is Sabbath, into the dark and frightening, secular workaday week, we sing the psalm “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall now want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters” (Ps. 23), etc., etc., and we believe with our entire hearts in the words of the psalmist. However, this psalm only describes the ultimate destination of homo religiosus , not the path leading to that destination. For the path that eventually will lead to the “green pastures” and to the “still waters” is not the royal road, but a narrow, twisting footway that threads its course along the steep mountain slope, as the terrible abyss yawns at the the travelers feet. Many see “the L-rd passing by; and a great and strong wind rending mountains and shattering rocks…and after the wind an earthquake…and after the earthquake a fire” but only a few prove worthy of hearing “the still small voice” (1 Kings 19:11-12). “Out of the straits have I called, O L-rd.” (Ps. 118:5). “Out of the depths I have called unto Thee, O L-rd.” (Ps. 130:1). Out of the straits of inner opposition and incongruities, spiritual doubts and uncertainties, out of the depths of a psyche rent with antinomies and contradictions, out of the bottomless pit of a soul that struggles with its own torments I have called, I have called unto Thee, O L-rd.

And when the Torah testified that Israel, in the end, would repent out of anguish and agony [cf. Maimonides, Laws of Repentance 7:5], “In your distress when all these things are come upon you…and you will return unto the L-rd your G-d” (Deut. 4:30), it had in mind not only physical pain but also spiritual suffering. The pangs of searching and groping, the tortures of spiritual crises and exhausting treks of the soul purify and sanctify man, cleanse his thoughts, and purge them of the husks of superficiality and the dross of vulgarity. Out of these torments there emerges a new understanding of the world, a powerful spiritual enthusiasm that shakes the very foundations of man’s existence. He arises from the agonies, purged and refined, possessed of a pure heart and new spirit. “It is a time of agony unto Jacob, but out of it shall he be saved” (Jer. 30:7) - i.e. from out of the very midst of the agony itself he will attain eternal salvation and redemption.

I am very sorry to say that the more I look into it, the more I become convinced that it is simply Postmodern Neo-Marxism repackaged with a new rhetorical facade.

As I see it, they buy into the silly materialist historical dialectic of Marx about the predictability of history. While I think the whole idea that it is possible to predict the course of human history foolish at best, the people who presume to bring about the Utopia they claim is inevitable are positively dangerous. There must always be a proper balance of the normative with the positive, one tempered by intellectual humility.

There is an atheism to the whole exercise which is destructive to the human spirit. At one end, you have the assertions of inevitable outcomes which can only lead to nihilist paralysis. At the other end, you have the presumption that the world is some sort of computer program which you as a god can hack because you have transcended it. The truth is that you are a finite being with limited capacity to change what is and a moral obligation to improve what you can.

The whole narrative I get from them is deeply flawed with inherent dissonance and incoherence which requires what I hate the most about the exercise: Obscurantism. Neologisms, jargon and impossible taboos designed to stifle knowledge production bandied about under the guise of sense-making.

You cannot possibly defend an intellectual house of cards without these obscurantist tactics.

Words are stripped of their normal definitions. Context is dropped. Historical antecedents and precedents are cut away. Instead of tracking the development of an idea in order to clarify its development and utility, you create a priesthood which guards the supposedly sacred definitions that the mere mortals must approach with awe.

Taboos are established which are deliberately vague, selectively enforced and impossible to obey. Only a Postmodernist or Neo-Marxist could possibly claim to disdain all rivalry, contention and oldthink. But that is precisely what they purport to do.

There are rules to knowledge production which completely shred everything I see coming out of this “scenius.”

Communicate clearly. Don’t create new words when old words suffice. Don’t use words outside of their normal usage. Don’t say more than necessary. Strive to be understood. Be precise in your definitions.

Discriminate deliberately. Reject the bad. Affirm the good. Have clear priorities. Establish clear boundaries. Respect the process. Punish misbehavior explicitly. Investigate contradictions.

Operate transparently. Cite your sources. Identify the leaders. Explain the processes. Publish your results. Encourage curiosity. Promote questioning. Challenge authority.

I see none of that operating.

These are the rules that they published for their Facebook Group.

Commitments:

I choose the path of Sovereignty. I choose to take full responsibility for myself in relationship with myself, other people and the world. I accept that this path is never ending and that the simple choice to undertake it is the first of many (often challenging) steps.

I choose to always endeavor to find the highest and best relationship with all others. I will seek to find a way of being in relationship that elevates both their Sovereignty and my own Sovereignty ongoingly.

I will apply Rules Alpha and Omega in my relationships with all who are in earnest and are in good faith trying to play game~b.

I will treat this community with respect and care.

I will take the time and undertake the effort necessary to realize these Commitments without compromise or excuse.

I understand that we are all learning and that this thing is hard. I will practice compassion, humility and forgiveness for myself and others.
Principles:

The Principle of Curiosity. Curiosity before knowing. If you already know how to do this thing, please just do it (elsewhere). This is not a place to market your program or beat the drum of your preferred ideology. It is a place where people can come and explore how to step into this new possibility themselves. A primary virtue, therefore, is curiosity. Be curious and play with curiosity.

The Principle of Discernment. Learn how to listen carefully. Both to find the signal and upregulate it and to find the noise and downregulate it. The effort here is more about building capacity in Discernment than in trying to get to the “truth” or the “right answer” in this Facebook group. This is more of a place of practice than of content.

The Principle of Focus. Focus on game~b. There is a fundamental assumption here that Game A and game~b are different and that Game A is not “the way”. Accordingly, this is not a place for trying to play Game A better. This is not a place to discuss Game A politics, policies or current events. This is a place to begin to learn how to play game~b. It can actually be quite hard leaving the buzz and salience of the Game A world behind. Practice focus.


I don’t even know where to start. It is all obscurantist bullshit. The minute I saw it, I knew that I would never join such a group.

“I will take the time and undertake the effort necessary to realize these Commitments without compromise or excuse.”

Will you really? So basically you are telling me that you are ideologically possessed?

“I will apply Rules Alpha and Omega in my relationships with all who are in earnest and are in good faith trying to play game~b.”

Rules with meaningless names that you do not explain and only apply to the in-group?

“There is a fundamental assumption here that Game A and game~b are different and that Game A is not ‘the way’.”

Just tell us you will be purging the Four Olds in a Maoist Cultural Revolution so we will more clearly know your aims.

I don’t quite understand how these ideas have infiltrated so deeply into IDW territory.

Cassandra, who was destined to prophecy tragedies and never to be believed? The boy who cried wolf?

I am not the type of person to cry wolf. If you would like proof, feel free to look up my editorials in the Daily Trojan from twenty years ago. (Unfortunately, it is not easy to link to the actual articles in the archives, but they are available.) I spent significant time complaining about all the cries of wolf at the time. People were making completely unworthy charges of antisemitism, racism and totalitarianism at the time. Over the past 20 years, things have not gotten better.

In fact, what has happened over the past 20 years is precisely what I constantly cautioned against. I kept on telling people not to cheapen Hitler analogies, not to cheapen charges of antisemitism, not to cheapen charges of racism. Well, nobody listened. The cries of wolf persisted and the Normies tuned out.

I would estimate that some 80% of the American public are Normies. That term is in no way derogatory. A Normie is simply a person who is doing the reasonable thing. They are people who have learned to tune out the constant refrain of wolf we have been subjected to. They are skeptical of our public intellectuals, who have proven themselves repeatedly to lack common sense and accountability. 

“Those whose careers are built on the creation and dissemination of ideas — the intellectuals — have played a role in many societies out of all proportion to their numbers. Whether that role has, on balance, made those around them better off or worse off is one of the key questions of our times.” - Thomas Sowell, Intellectuals and Society 2020

The idea of “fakenews” has become a defining characteristic of the distrust we have in society. The rise of anti-vaxxers, flatearthers and various conspiracy theorists of all types is symptomatic of the deterioration of our social fabric. This deterioration is dangerous and endemic.

Knowledge production is the most important function of our species. It is makes us the apex predator, it is what keeps us alive, it is what makes humanity succeed.

I am not saying that all is bad with our society. Any reasonable person looks at the state of our society and recognizes that we all live in a profoundly better world by every single measure than any of our grandparents. It is a rare person who can credibly claim to live a worse life than even the most privileged person of 40 years ago. We are the luckiest people to ever live, especially those of us who are privileged to be Americans.

So I do not blame the people who keep on insisting that everything is fine. I cannot blame them. It is easy to point to many factors which militate towards optimism and mitigate whatever dangers I may be pointing out. I show people termites and they assume that I am only looking at particular problems. The termites are in that wall or in that plank, they cannot be eating the foundations of the house.

It is hard, maybe even impossible, to convince the average person that we are headed towards the roof caving in. After all, how many prophecies of the world’s end have we already lived through?

The problem is: Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.

I know this sounds insane to the Normies. What does that even mean? Who killed him? Why should anyone disbelieve the coroner? To what end? And even if he was murdered, who cares? A pedophile murdered in prison in hardly news. Why should it matter?

It matters. It matters because it says something profoundly worrying about our society. It matters because large numbers of people believe it. It matters because it is true.

I don’t claim to know what happened in that jail cell. I don’t think Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump personally walked into that cell and strangled the man. I am not even sure that there was any other person in that cell when Jeffrey Epstein died. He may have fashioned a noose. He may have put it around his own neck. He may have found a way, as implausible as it is, to break those bones in his neck.

That doesn’t mean he killed himself. Jeffrey Epstein was someone who was supposed to be prevented from killing himself. By every measure, the ability of Jeffrey Epstein to kill himself was a failure in the most basic function of our society. You had one job! Just one job! After a previous attempt, there was no excuse whatsoever for him to be alone in a cell. Nobody even purports to have an excuse for why he was alone. We are told it was a comedy of errors including two different camera malfunctions, two overworked guards, a lapse in procedures, etc.

Jeffrey Epstein is dead. So what?

Well, if his death really is so irrelevant, then why has the criminal justice system ground to a halt? Who is being held responsible for this failure? Did Epstein really do everything he is alleged to have done by himself? We know there were others involved. Where are the investigators promising to find out what happened?

The Normies don’t know. The Normies don’t want to know. That is not going to put groceries on the table, help my kids with their homework, get me a bonus at the end of the year, rotate my tires or do any of the million things that a Normie has to get done. People are busy. They have dishes to wash, shirts to iron, food to prepare, miles to drive, paper to push, emails to answer.

What would it mean if Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself? It would mean that the newspapers are lying. It would mean that the coroner is not doing her job. It would mean that the police are not doing their job. It would mean that the whole justice system has failed. It would mean that our society is unraveling.

You cannot possibly believe that is true. How could you? What would you do if it were true? What could you do? How would you get out of bed in the morning? How would you sleep at night? It is all too much.

Jeffrey Epstein must have killed himself because anything else is too horrible to contemplate. It would mean we live in a dystopian nightmare. It would make movies like the Matrix into reality and real life absurd.

Few people have the courage of their convictions. Many more people are convinced by their cowardice.

Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself. It is not reasonable to conclude that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. The evidence to the contrary is far too overwhelming. The horror of that conclusion is even more overwhelming.

“Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!”, cries Cassandra. Everybody just goes about their life, paying no attention.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Nov 6, 2019, 4:13 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Joker</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>When I was in undergrad, the Hebrew poet Yehuda Amichai came and spoke to a small crowd at my school. Someone asked him to explain a poem and he said that would be wrong of him. He said he was like a tomato farmer and poems are like tomatoes. The tomato farmer cannot tell you that a tomato is for use in salads or sauces or whatever. You bought the tomato, it is yours to do with as you wish.

That is the type of memorable imagery you expect from a great poet. It is also bullshit. No serious mind gives credence to the idea that what is in the artist’s head in any way defines art. You have to be a college professor or an art critic to believe that, which many of the “Intellectual Yet Idiots” do. It is impossible to know what is in someone else’s mind even when you can ask them. Do they even know? Does the artist remember what they were thinking at any given moment in the process? What about collaborative efforts? Forget about the dead ones. Art is defined by the audience.

Inasmuch as Amichai rejected the authority of the artist over the interpretation of his work, I agree. That isn’t the call of the question. The poet can certainly tell you more about the symbolism, history and development of the poem. Asking a tomato farmer his opinion is very different from allowing him to dictate how tomatoes may be used. The author is part of the audience, at the very least.

I think this recognition of an inherent disconnect between the artist and the art is incredibly important. Part of what makes great art great is that it speaks to a wide variety of people through time and space. How I see the Mona Lisa is not how Leonardo saw her. Leonardo and I have little in common. Art operates on a level of abstraction that allows it to escape mortal coil.

The fact I need this preamble to start discussing the new Joker movie is itself rather shocking. A friend of mine raved so much about it that I decided to go see it in a theater. Before we had gotten even one minute into the movie, I was reminded why I so rarely do that. I had to move my seat twice to avoid inconsiderate people and couldn’t pause it to take an important phone call. I was sure it couldn’t possibly be as good as she said.

It was.

I am frankly surprised that such artistry still exists in Hollywood. Joker might not even be nominated for an Academy Award. I think it should win all of them.

It was not an enjoyable movie. It was not the type of exercise in torture that I have come to expect from Hollywood. It is a movie that shows the human condition in ways that are incredibly important for today’s society. People from all walks of life are going to pour their passion and their selves into this vessel.

I am glad it was made. I am glad that it is a hit. This is a very important contribution to human culture.

BUT....

I have grave reservations about how well people will understand our communal reaction to this movie. People on the right are claiming Joker as some sort of anthem against the worst excesses of the left, which it may partly be. I can only imagine that Robert De Niro and Joaquin Phoenix, as well as the other creators, will scoff because they see the movie as the precise opposite. They likely think, and I agree, that it is a liberal anthem.

This is the genius of art. It escapes from its creators. The problem is that the phenomenon of “one screen, two movies” is actually literal here. People are looking at the same screen and seeing different movies based on their political biases. That is a recipe for disaster, most prominently for the people who misinterpret the work.

Yes, you can misinterpret a work of art. There are right and wrong interpretations of art, even the greatest art. There may be many competing interpretations. That doesn’t change the fact that some are wrong.

Joker excels in that it vividly describes many of our society’s most important problems. That is one of the greatest things a work of art can achieve. It is itself worthy of great praise.

Where Joker fails, at least as a conservative anthem, is its clearly liberal bias.

The difference between liberals and conservatives should not be in the perception of the problem. We should be able to see the same problem. What the conservatives are rejoicing at is an acknowledgement that the Left has finally deigned to see the problems we see. Single white men cannot be eternally kicked. They will not just lay down and die, curled up in the fetal position for your post-birth abortion. Donald Trump deserves far more credit for this realization than even his biggest supporters will give him. As Michael Moore put it, Trump is a brick that the American people have decided to throw through the establishment’s window. Joker is the broken glass.

What society needs, what society has always needed, is people seeing different possible solutions to our universally acknowledged problems. That intellectual diversity is what we need, if our society is to function well. Joker did not provide that and it did not provide that by design. I am happy that the Left has finally started seeing the problem. I hope that they will not be surprised to learn that conservatives have been seeing these problems for a long time. I see no indication in this movie that they do.

Let’s look at the framing of the problem. Arthur is a poor, single, mentally ill man who takes care of his mother. He tries his best, he has problems, he isn’t terribly bright, he has the world stacked against him. His social worker informs him that funding cuts are closing her office. Arthur asks where he will go to get his medication. She offers no answer. The eeevvvviiiillll Republicans have tied her hands.

Of course, a real social worker would never act this way. She would tell Arthur to ask at his church.

WHAT?!?!?!?!

A church? That didn’t cross your mind? That is likely because you are thinking like a Leftist.

Allow me to describe the situation in ways that the Hollywood left never will. I have a bit of experience actually trying to help people, not simply virtue signalling my attempts to help others. I worked at a homeless shelter, I work with low income populations.

Someone like Arthur most likely already “self-medicates” with drugs or alcohol. Even if not Arthur, every competent person in the role of his social worker has a majority of clients who are addicted to some substance. A list of 12 step programs, which have explicitly Christian roots, would be one of her most valued resources. The Salvation Army and various religious organizations are incredibly important resources. Where was that in the movie?

I could go through the rest of the movie in a similar vein. What family support structures existed? Why all the single mothers? Who let a single woman adopt a child in the 50’s? Why were people giving guns away like candy to obviously disturbed people?

This was not a right-wing movie. It was a left-wing movie that finally acknowledges some of the problems that conservatives have been harping on. It proposes precisely zero conservative solutions. Let Robert De Niro be your proof. He would not make a conservative anthem. He viewed his role as neutral to his personal agenda, if not supportive. As incredibly lacking in self-awareness as it seems, he didn’t quite grasp how much his role was merely a cameo of his real self or he would not have been involved.

I am glad that Hollywood can still make art. I am glad that Hollywood is applying its artistry to important problems. I just wish that it could be a bit more realistic and transparent about the proposed solutions. Medicare-for-All, gun control and wealth redistribution are not our only options. 

We could also try stronger family ties, community organizations like churches and private charity. That isn’t a movie Hollywood would make.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Oct 17, 2019, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">The Generation after the Acharonim</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I have been trying to figure out what I believe my whole life. That is the journey of faith and it is the essence of human life. We live our lives and we try to understand how best to do that. For quite some time I tried to find which group I belonged to with regard to my beliefs. Most recently, I considered myself an adherent to the beliefs of Chabad which is a movement within Hasidism which is a movement within Orthodox Judaism which is a form of Judaism.

I still believe in Judaism. I believe in the Thirteen Principles of Jewish Faith. I believe in the Shulchan Aruch. I believe in the Torah that was taught by the Baal Shem Tov and his students.

What I no longer believe is that we are still in the time of the Acharonim. Jewish history is split into several eras by the teachers who existed at each time. There were the Early Prophets then the Latter Prophets then the Tannaim then the Amoraim then the Gaonim then the Rishonim then the Acharonim. The Tannaim included Hillel, the Amoraim included Resh Lakish, the Gaonim included Saadia Gaon, the Rishonim included Rashi and the Acharonim included Rabbi Yosef Caro.

Acharonim literally means “the last ones.”

What do you do when there are no more last ones? I no longer believe that it is possible to be a dayan, a sofer, a shochet or even a kosher witness. I don’t believe that it is possible to form a minyan, write a sefer Torah or produce kosher food.

I pray that these things may one day become possible again. That we will be able to have marriage ceremonies and Torah readings. That we will be able to form minyanim for prayer. I simply don’t see these things as being possible anymore.

What do you call that?

In a sense, I think it is an individualist Judaism. It is Judaism without a community. It is Judaism without leadership. It is a failed Judaism where all you can do is wait for Elijah to come.

“I believe with full faith in the coming of the Messiah, and although he may delay, I will await his coming each day.”

Is this still Orthodox Judaism? I think so, but I don’t think it is what Orthodox Judaism recognizes as Judaism.

It is my Judaism and nobody else’s.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Sep 9, 2019, 8:53 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Not Normal...</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Let’s talk about the fundamentals here.

Normal society is when people can walk around and pretty much expect things to be as they have always been. When I go to Costco, I know there will be rotisserie chicken and bread. There may be other things, but there will be rotisserie chicken and bread. Sometimes they run out of chicken. Sometimes they change the bread. But I can pretty much trust that if I go to Costco, I can buy chicken and bread.

We do this a lot. There are a lot of things we depend on. We pretty much know what is legal or not. If a cop stops us as we are driving, we can guess what the result would be. We might get a ticket for speeding or a broken tail light. That is normal.

Now imagine that a cop stops you and says he wants to talk to you about your Instagram post. You posted a rap lyric that was offensive.  You are taken to court and convicted. You receive 8 weeks of probation.

That is not normal. The rules are being changed on us.

Okay, change is itself normal. Sometimes Costco runs out of chicken and sometimes Costco changes what it offers. Things change. Change is normal.

There is a rate of change that isn’t normal. Sometimes things change too fast, too weirdly. What you depend on can no longer be depended on. You can’t do things the way you assumed that you could. Things are too abnormal.

So you try to readjust. You try to make sense of the changes. You try to figure out what is going on and adapt to the new normal.

Except you see that there is no new normal. You cannot figure out what the new norms are. You are confused, fearful, distrustful. You want to go back to the old normal. You want to know what is going on again. Again.

That is when you become a reactionary.

That is the problem when you try to change things too fast. That is what radicals do. They want dramatic change, without waiting for people to readjust. That is what the radicals are doing now.

But the problem is deeper than that. This fight between people who want to change things and people who want things to stay the same is not new. It has always existed.

What is not normal is that the radicals of today don’t want there to be a normal. They don’t want to change the norms. They want to destroy the idea of norms. This is not itself so weird, radicals have always wanted the world to play by their rules. They wanted to get rid of money and hierarchy. It didn’t work out so well. They tried to get rid of the traditional family and religion. It didn’t work out so well.

Now they are trying to destroy the idea of norms. It is not working out so well.

Maybe someone should stop these radicals from having so much power to decide what happens. Maybe. The problem is that we don’t know how they got this power. We weren’t paying attention as they took over. We had better things to do. Most people have better things to do.

And while we were all doing those better things, the radicals did take over. They took over Academia. They took over politics. They took over the media. Because they don’t have better things to do. That is all they care about. That is all they do.

Unfortunately, these radicals have convinced themselves of the lie that reality doesn’t really exist. They believe that they can fly. They believe we can fly. So they are steering off a cliff to prove that we can fly. We can’t fly.

How do we stop them? I don’t know. I do know that we cannot fly.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Aug 9, 2019, 4:13 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Mechanisms of Insurance</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>There is a very common misconception about insurance. It stems from the very simple model of insurance that is taught by economists. In economics, risk refers to the variability of outcome. A risk can be speculative, meaning that it is possible to have an up side. A lottery ticket has lots of risk in economic terms, because the possible results can vary greatly. 

Harry Markowitz won the Nobel Prize in Economics by describing how different financial portfolios can have an optimal risk frontier. This led to the common rule of thumb in investing that you should diversify.

Given the idea that risk can have an up side, it is possible for someone to be both rational and risk seeking. Others can be rational and risk averse. The simplest model of insurance describes the price of insurance as a premium that the risk averse pay to the risk seeking for off-loading the risk they would rather not have. This transaction even destroys some wealth, since the transaction costs are consuming wealth for no good reason.

That doesn’t take into consideration what modern insurance does. Modern insurance actually does not deal with speculative risk at all. Modern insurance only deals with pure risk, meaning only the possibility of a negative result. It also works because the expected value of the risk in the hands of the insurer is higher (less negative) than it is in the hands of the insured.

Let’s take the most basic form of modern insurance: fire insurance on a home. Fire insurance, like all modern insurance, came alive in London. Very specific conditions existed in London which made insurance possible. The most important innovation which made fire insurance profitable was professional fire fighters. Insurers would issue a policy which promised to pay out in case your home or furnishings were destroyed in a fire. The insurer then gave you a badge to put on your home and hired a crew of professional fire fighters. Whenever there was a fire, the crew would come to your house and minimize the amount of damage done. 

Fire insurance companies still do this, actually. That is why when there was a fire in Los Angeles recently, private firefighters went to the home of Kanye West to minimize the damage.

This basic principle applies in many different ways. The end result, however, is always the same. The insurer reduces the expected value of the loss and makes its profits from the difference. The insured pays a premium that is actually usually much lower than the expected value of the loss in the hands of the insured.

There are 4 major methods by which the insurer reduces the expected value of the loss. I am trying to be brief, so I will give simple examples. These methods are actually used far more broadly.

The first method is called underwriting. This is when an insurance company rejects an application for insurance given certain conditions. This is why we no longer have diving boards in homes. Insurers will not insure homes with diving boards nor insure people who make or install diving boards. This actually acts to improve our society significantly in markets where insurance exists. I could give many examples of tiny requirements insurers put in underwriting guidelines. Deadbolts on your doors and circuit breakers on your wiring are two more. While the insurer doesn’t benefit when it turns down business, society does. Not being able to insure a risk is proof positive that it is a significant risk. If you cannot insure your home, your home is at significant risk of being destroyed. Not being able to get life insurance means that you are at significant risk of dying. This is information that the insurer is developing for society as a whole.

A second method is by reapportioning incentives. Consider worker compensation insurance. An employer has incentives to increase the productivity of employees, but not necessarily to keep the employees from being injured. The way worker compensation works is by shifting the liability of the employer to an insurer which will have responsibility for the employees injuries even after the employer ceases to function. Take miners as an example. The miner may develop ailments related to mining long after the mine has closed down. The financial incentives to the insurer are divorced from the financial incentives of the employer. At the same time, the insurer can start incentivizing the employees or even placing restrictions on the employer. Placing the proper incentive in the right hands has a significant effect on decision making that can reduce the possibility and magnitude of a possible loss.

A third method is by actually reducing the expected loss. Think of the firefighters. Insurers also built lighthouses, spread the invention of life boats, started the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and many other ways. Jewelry insurers famously hire detectives to retrieve stolen jewels. Kidnapping insurers have professional negotiators to reduce the amount of the ransom! This also includes things like hiring a network of doctors to treat people who get sick as well as demanding those doctors use the most cost effective methods to treat the patient. Insurers will fund research, lobby legislators and educate the public. The bigger the difference between the risk (and remember we only talk about pure risk in insurance) in the hands of the insured and the hands of the insurer, the more profitable the contract becomes to the insurer.

The fourth method is through financial management of the loss reserves. There is the time value of money to consider between when the insurer receives the money and when the insurer pays out the loss. Insurance companies are some of the largest institutional investors in our economy. With life insurance, the time the reserve spends in the hands of the insurer can actually be the most significant factor in the profits of the insurer.

One method that most definitely does not work, despite what many people think, is simply denying claims. Denying legitimate claims causes insurance markets to fail. That is one of the many reasons insurance can only exist in a highly regulated market like the conditions that first came up in London. The unique circumstances prevented the insurers from denying claims. When people do not expect the insurer to actually pay the claim, they simply will not buy insurance at all. Every insurer has a very important incentive to make sure that other insurers pay their claims and that the law forces other insurers to pay their claims. Otherwise, there will be no insurance at all.

Ultimately, the mechanisms of insurance make the system as a whole far more efficient than it exists without insurance. The simple model of insurance provided by economists is only the beginning of the story. Switching from speculative to pure risk is an important first step in understanding why that model is too simple. Eliminating insurers from situations where the mechanisms of insurance apply only reduces the amount of wealth in the system, it does not free up transaction costs.

Some people would like to think that the government could do these things just as well as private insurance. That is manifestly untrue for the same reason that capitalism always works better than government attempts to duplicate it. Let’s compare Original Medicare which is administered by the federal government to Medicare Advantage which is administered by private insurance companies, both for profit and non-profit.  Original Medicare does not pay for gym memberships or Viagra. Every Medicare Advantage plan I know pays for gym memberships and Viagra. Why? Because a government program has to convince the public and politicians that paying for Viagra is a good idea. A private plan simply has to check to see if free gym memberships and Viagra cost less than the amount by which they reduce healthcare claims. It is the profit motive which ensures that insurers act in a way that reduces the destruction of wealth, creates wealth and delivers benefits to the insured that no political process can provide.

One Medicare Advantage plan I know has found that paying rent for certain clients means fewer hospital visits and costs less than allowing that client to be evicted. Will Bernie Sanders be able to convince the American people that paying rent would reduce the cost of Medicare for All? Would his Medicare for All be able to identify the conditions under which that or paying for meals or some other service would reduce the costs to the taxpayer? I doubt it.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Aug 1, 2019, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Lobster Think Tank 2.0</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Axiom: The irreducible minimum requirement for cooperation between human beings is the capacity to focus attention in a coordinated manner.

Cogito, ergo sum.

This is a continuation of my musings on human cooperation. 

I have been trying to figure out a system of cooperation for people that properly engages the Information Superhighway. It is not an easy task. I unfortunately lack the computer programming resources and experience necessary to build a platform. I have been thinking that object oriented programming and collaborative online efforts do constitute important models that we can learn from. I also think that Dr. Jordan Peterson is essentially right in emphasizing the role of attention and the necessity to pick a correct level of analysis.

I believe that a good system has to be easily iterated. It should be like the grain of crystal that forms the kernel in a super-saturated solution. The most fundamental question is: Where do we start with such a system? Defining words? Creating groups? Setting goals? I believe that the basic axiom of such a system needs to be a tautology.

I think that basic axiom is that we need to be paying attention in a coordinated manner. That forms the undeniable basis to start, much like Descartes’s statement of “I think, therefore I am.” 

If you don’t agree that people paying attention in a coordinated manner is the basis of cooperation, I don’t think you can cooperate. Once a human being loses interest in the topic at hand, then that person cannot cooperate. That is the axiom that I am proposing. That is the discussion I want to have with the people who want to cooperate with me.

Once you have agreed to that axiom, we can start building on it. I believe the following syntax is a viable starting point.

Always start with defining what we are paying attention to. I believe it may be useful to use the following markers. Thesis, proposition, goal, define, axiom, reject. I also believe self-referential marker are necessary to engage in a meta conversation linked to the current topic. We must be able to build a chain. We need to be able to modulate the level of analysis. I propose tangent, meta and focus.

The following is an example:

Goal: Create an optimal system of cooperation for people using contemporary tools for contemporary problems

That could act like the Uniform Resource Locator for everyone who is interested in this topic. If the discussion is going off topic, then the person has changed their attention from the topic at hand. That person needs to acknowledge the new topic and create a new resource location. 

So let’s say that I wanted to discuss whether “Lobster Think Tank 2.0” is the correct title for this post. Instead of including that discussion here, I would simply drop an anchor.

Meta: What is the proper identifier [for Goal: Create an optimal system of cooperation for people using contemporary tools for contemporary problems]

The last part of that sentence may not be necessary in this syntax. If I wanted to focus on a particular objective of the goal, I could drop a similar anchor like any of the below.

Focus: Create a measure for optimization of systems of cooperation for people

Define: Contemporary

Thesis: Contemporary tools and problems are not essential components

Proposition: Groups of 300 are the largest groups of people who can work together productively

If a person’s attention shifts, it is necessary to point to how that attention shifted, if it relates to that topic. Certain things like theses, definitions, propositions and axioms could be adopted by individuals. This would constitute knowledge production for that individual.

I think the following assumptions are necessary.

First, we need to use words uniquely. I think a good way to start is to say that every word is used in the manner and with the unique meaning that Merriam Webster online dictionary assigns to it. Optimally, we would stop using words with multiple meanings, but the dictionary provides numbers to those meanings. If you want to use the word in a different way, you need to use a word not in that dictionary.

Second, we must assume a certain amount of good faith and capability. People who spam, disrupt or are simply incapable of contributing need to kept out of the system. If that is done, it is possible to assume that any disagreement on the current focus justifies a fork. This would obviate the need for moderation. A good faith recognition that your attention differs from the attention of others would allow anyone to create a new resource location to contain their thoughts.

Third, as constituted, this only addresses how people pay attention. It will be necessary to fine tune this system to account for people’s unique expertise, group cohesion, hierarchy, reward, etc.

Is the axiom I propose valid? Can we use it as the essential building block for group cooperation? Can technology easily accommodate this syntax? Thoughts? </div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Mar 18, 2019, 4:59 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Cognition, Rectification and Chabad</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Over the summer, I learned that someone I knew at Chabad &#064; USC completed suicide. We recently gathered at the Chabad House to remember him. It was a difficult time. Rabbi Dov Wagner spoke about how the living should learn lessons in remembering those who have passed, “take it to heart.” Ben’s father spoke about how they wish they had known how he was suffering so they could have helped him more. I spoke about how Ben was always smiling and the permanent dimple that reminded me of him. 

The question that really bothered all of us was: What could we do?

I proposed the only answer that could come to my mind, but it simply didn’t seem enough. I suggested that we all learn about cognitive distortions and how to diffuse them. That is the best way we know scientifically proven to treat anxiety and depression. It may even work better than medication.

Somehow, that just fell short. We were at Chabad. It was a clinical answer to what appears to be a spiritual problem.  Surely Chabad would have a Jewish answer to the horrible epidemic of suicide we face. The Torah was given to us so that we may live. L’chaim! To life!

At the same time, a platitude like “do another mitzvah” also didn’t do it. It seemed both superstitious and unavailing. Putting on tefillin and lighting candles helps us connect to Judaism, feel spiritual and build a community. It doesn’t cure depression.

I was reminded of the story about the page of Hasidic teaching that was found in a mound of garbage. The Alter Rebbe had analogized the spread of the mystical, secret parts of the Torah to the jewel of a king’s crown. If the prince was sick, the king would destroy his crown to use the jewel to heal him. If the prince was so sick that the precious medicine made with the precious jewel would spill, let it spill.

That story never sat well with me either. Medicine needs exact dosages. You don’t just spill medicine all over the place in the hopes that some of it makes it to the right place. Medicine that heals one person can kill another. The Sayings of the Sages warn us that teaching without care may lead to disaster. This is a common criticism of Chabad within Judaism, that they are too free in “spilling” the precious Torah everywhere.

Then it hit me. “The Book of the Average Person.” Not only are the lessons that today’s psychologists tell us will keep our minds healthy ancient truths. Not only are these truths contained within Judaism. The methods of cognitive behavioral therapy actually mirror the fundamental teachings at the core of Chabad philosophy.

Unlike all other Hasidic dynasties, Chabad is not known simply by the name of the city it originates from (Lubavitch). Chabad is an acronym of the three mental faculties as taught in the Kabbalah. It takes its name from the first letter of Chochmah (Wisdom), Binah (Intelligence) and Da’at (Understanding). 

The essential text at the foundation of Chabad is usually referred to as the Tanya, which is the first word of the book and simply means “it was taught.” The actual title of the book is simply Likutei Amarim (Collected Sayings) which is also the title of many other Jewish books. The unique title which the author gave it always puzzled me. The first part is called Sefer shel Beinonim. That translates to the Book of the Average People.

To say that I had difficulties with the text is an understatement. Three particular things always bothered me about the Tanya. First, I always bristled at the story of the well-known and saintly Rabbi Hillel Paricher reading it and saying “If only I were an average person!” I never saw how it is a good thing for someone to think of himself as less than the great man he was. Second, I was always uncomfortable with the line “how could Rabbah err.” It seemed presumptuous to me to say that a sage of the Talmud acted in such clear error. Third, I could not understand why the essential text would be about being a Beinoni (average person) instead of a Tsaddik (righteous person).

Except that is precisely what psychologists tell us is the healthiest way for a person to view themselves. The essence of CBT is to see things through the middle path, as Maimonides summarizes in Hilchot De’ot 1:4. “The straight path: This [involves discovering] the midpoint temperament of each and every trait that man possesses [within his personality.] This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them. Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits, to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path, so that he will be sound &#123;of body&#125;.”

Using CBT techniques to avoid extremes, it makes sense even for a sage like Rabbah to view himself as an average person. The attempt to be perfect, not accepting any faults within yourself, has been shown to be emotionally harmful. The story of Reb Hillel Paricher no longer makes me bristle in that light.

Most importantly, it makes sense for Chabad Houses on college campuses to be “spilling” these ideas everywhere. Cognitive distortions are a poison that are literally killing our young. These “patterns of thought that are surprisingly similar to those long identified by cognitive behavioral therapists as causes of depression and anxiety.”

Unlike other medicines, which you should not give the healthy, CBT techniques act to prevent mental illness. Like an encompassing light, it doesn’t conform to its vessel, and makes no distinction between healthy or sick. Even a person who is constantly smiling to hide his depression can be helped.

I intend to spend some time finding the correspondence between various CBT techniques to avoid cognitive distortions and what I know of Judaism. There are many specifics and I am no expert in either. The similarities, however, have given me a lot of hope about the ability of Chabad Houses to help remedy some of the most important problems facing our society today.</div><div class="_2pic"><table class="uiGrid _51mz" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr class="_51mx"><td class="_51m- pas"><div><a href="photos_and_videos/your_posts/50217159_2321824744770946_3174782989900972032_n_2321824741437613.jpg"><img src="photos_and_videos/your_posts/50217159_2321824744770946_3174782989900972032_n_2321824741437613.jpg" class="_2yuc _3-96" /></a><div class="_3-95">Ben Beezy</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Jan 13, 2019, 8:44 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Traumatic Memories</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Given the current news and the fact so many people are talking about it, I thought I would explain my feelings on a subject I know all too well: traumatic memories. People seem to be convinced that someone has to be lying in this situation, which is completely untrue.

First, let’s start with the fact that all memories are in some sense unreliable. Forensic scientists have long been dealing with the problem of “eye-witness” testimony. This is an area that psychologists are studying, especially in the light of DNA evidence overturning false convictions. People are rightly trying to figure out how these convictions happened, which has lead to new insights. The important thing to my mind is this statement: “Like trace evidence, eyewitness evidence can be contaminated, lost, destroyed or otherwise made to produce results that can lead to an incorrect reconstruction of the crime.”

That doesn’t mean you automatically discount someone’s memory. It means that we have to be careful before we call a memory true or a lie. It might be true, it might be a lie or it may be contaminated. Traumatic, repressed memories recovered in therapy are invariably contaminated.

Traumatic memories are inherently unreliable when they are formed because what makes them traumatic is the fact the person forming them is having difficulty understanding what is going on. The case everyone is talking about is actually a perfect example. You have a young person suddenly thrust into a situation where she is being assailed and feels her life is in danger. She doesn’t understand what is going on and has no idea how to deal with it. Recording something we don’t understand is difficult precisely because we don’t understand it which makes it so hard for us to deal with it as human beings.

I won’t go into unnecessary detail. You can read her account if you wish or anyone else’s account for that matter. It is so familiar to me that it has become cliche. Shame, terror, confusion, panic. This is a horrible thing to go through. Which is the reason why so many people repress these traumatic memories and at the same time cannot help but to be affected by them.

Which starts the process of repression which makes the memory even less reliable. The account that is currently under discussion is again very familiar. The person thinks to themselves that I will never talk about it to anyone, no one will know and I will forget it. This is not surprising behavior, it is typical behavior. We try very hard to forget. Maybe there are people who are successful. We’ll never know because we can only ever know when this process fails. Which it does spectacularly.

Consider the cycle of consciously trying to forget while your subconscious keeps on bringing up this horrible image. There is a very good reason why the best method we have of treating PTSD is to directly address the traumatic memory. Fighting the memory causes it to grow with your fears. The repression process compounds itself, making the situation worse. It snowballs. Details creep in that may be even worse than the reality. Each time the memory comes up and is repressed, it can become further distorted. You can end up with a phantasm which is obviously impossible, but you cannot face because it is so terrible.

The treatment is to confront the memory and cut it down to size. To rob it of the emotional charge in the safe confines of psychotherapy. Once you are able to think it through, you are able to try and make sense of that memory.  You are able to integrate it, understand it, come to terms with it and move forward.

That is the process of “recovering” the “memory” in therapy. You start going towards the memory with all its horrors and trying to finally tame it. The details are difficult and emotional. Many of them never really formed in your mind to begin with, which is part of what made the event traumatic in the first place. Many details were filled in by your worst fears. It is actually possible to traumatize yourself with these memories which can cause emotional damage as you rip open the scar.

Too many people discount this process as somehow useless or unhelpful or worse. It isn’t. It can, when done with the guidance of a professional, be incredibly helpful. You end up with something you can understand and integrate. Your understanding of yourself and the world can be whole. You stop fighting yourself. You end up being able to live your life without the constant battle between conscious and subconscious.

In the hands of an incompetent or untrained person, the process of recovering a memory may in fact be harmful. You can create a trauma. A fabrication insinuated innocently or even maliciously. I have no indication whatsoever that this is the case, but people in therapy are very vulnerable. It should come as no surprise that an incompetent therapist can do terrible damage, no more than the fact that an incompetent surgeon can kill the patient. You are cutting a person open emotionally.

In the end, even when dealt with by someone expert as a therapist, what you end up with is no longer really a memory if it ever was one. It is scar tissue. Which is the problem. Some people want to pretend like the scar tissue doesn’t exist or the wound never happened. That is wrong. The wound happened and recovered memories are in fact real impressions made on your mind during a traumatic event. It isn’t something completely imaginary. Competent therapists know better than to create such artifacts where none exist.

At the same time, the memory is no longer reliable even with the help of the best therapist. It is impossible to tell which details were recorded correctly during a traumatic event. It is impossible to tell which details were disfigured by the process of repressing the memory. It is impossible to tell which details changed as you process the memory during therapy. Memories change each time you recall the event. That is part of what makes therapy valuable! 

We are talking about a memory that has been through hundreds and thousands of cycles, each one distorting it in one way or another. What is left is most definitely not a representation of what a video camera would have recorded.

So, no. I don’t think anybody is lying here while at the same time I don’t think that the accusation is in any way reliable. Both can be true. People who go through this process are doing difficult work to deal with a horrible situation. They are to be treated with respect and compassion. At the same time, that final understanding is the least reliable of all memories and should never be used in any criminal proceeding.  It is not a memory at all, it is an artifact that can be safely discarded once it has lost its emotional charge.

The person coming forward now should know that herself, as a therapist who trains other therapists. This is, by far, the most disturbing thing about the situation to me. I worry far more about the therapists she trains and their patients than any single person being accused right now. She should know better. The resultant memory is unreliable. It is completely unreliable and should never be treated otherwise. The therapist, at least, should keep that in mind always.

If you are interested in learning more, you might consider the book The Myth of Repressed Memory. As you consider it, please keep in mind the authors’s note that it is not an indictment of therapy techniques, it is a scholarly review of why these memories should not be considered by anyone as reliable. Especially by the person who has finally integrated them, but also by the therapist and society in general. The authors are not therapists, they are expert witnesses. (I haven’t read this book in particular, but it appears to be a studied recounting of things I have read in a large amount of scholarly works on the phenomenon.)

The myth is not that there are traumatic images in the person’s mind which need to be integrated. The myth is that the process “recovers” a “memory” as opposed to helping the person being treated to make sense of a disturbing event in a way they can live with. What you end up with is not a recovered memory that was repressed. It is an account of an incomprehensible horror that you can finally understand.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Sep 16, 2018, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Lobster Think Tank</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I have been thinking a lot about a particular disruption in our capacity to deliberate collectively that has been identified by intellectuals I find particularly compelling. (I previously wrote another reflection on this issue.)

In order to work together, we have to organize. There is no question about that. That is the definition of “together.” Working together, we can get more done. There is no question about that, either. Those are about the only things I don’t have questions about.

Group dynamics are incredibly complex. Many different disciplines study these dynamics. Many different disciplines are defined by these dynamics. Economics, political science, business, sociology, law, psychology, communication and others could be defined as studies of specific interactions between humans.

How we define these dynamics is essential to who we are. They actually define who we are. What has been most surprising to me, however, is the realization that these dynamics are not merely psychological. They are also biological and most importantly neurological.

How we think is affected by our biology. This shouldn’t be surprising, but I think it is. You think differently when you are hungry than when you are full. You think differently when you are tired than when you are well-rested.

That is not to say that I believe we live in a deterministic world. I don’t. I do decide what I buy when I go to Costco, regardless of whether I am hungry or satiated. But everyone who shops at Costco knows you should never go shopping at Costco on an empty stomach.

Our concepts of interpersonal dynamics do not reflect this reality. Our laws do not adequately account for the fact that 24 year old people do not have fully formed prefontal cortices. Our political models never discuss what time of day people vote or whether they do it on an empty stomach. Communications classes did not prepare me to address the fact that a female audience is likely to see color very differently than a male audience.

In fact, I grew up thinking the fact women wear colorful dresses and men wear drab clothes was purely a social construct. It isn’t! Men are far more likely to be colorblind than women. This is an important fact to know when you are creating a presentation and the answer cannot be to reduce everything to what accommodates the colorblind. Does anyone think that is fair for women to be limited by the lower physical capacity of men?

Puts a very different twist on the “physical capacity to be a soldier” when you are talking about airline pilots, doesn’t it? What would our police force look like if we disqualified anyone who is colorblind?

We have a knowledge explosion. We have greater mobility than ever before. We have greater inter-connectivity than ever before. Not only is the speed of change changing, but so is the rate at which the speed changes.

I simply don’t think the way we related with each other is capable of keeping up. A society that made laws by sending dozens of men to a meeting in a capital city was able to react to the changing needs of its population. We simply cannot make laws in the same manner. We can no longer organize ourselves in the same manner.

And organize ourselves, we must! We live in a world where the individual simply cannot be a jack-of-all-trades in any sense of the word. We can no longer depend on the computing capacity of a single brain. Our society can no longer be limited to the bandwidth of one person’s senses. 

So, what do we do?

I think we have to build a new system from scratch. The United States famously uses its 50 different laboratories of democracies to try things out. But I think we need to see things tried out at a more fundamental level. I think we need people to come together and re-imagine interpersonal relationships at the level of the individual.

Jordan Peterson famously referred to the inevitability that our interpersonal relationships will end up bearing some relationship to how lobsters organize themselves in hierarchies. (He was not saying that they should, but only that they have that tendency!)

So how about the Lobsters (as his fans are sometimes jokingly referred to), actually run some experiments? Let’s get together and crowdsource some ideas on what a hierarchy of competence should look like.

Here is my attempt at brainstorming some of the characteristics I think maybe should describe such a relationship:

Competent, stable, redundant, able, agile, rewarding, capable, interactive, flexible, redundant, efficient, incremental, practical, merciful, pure, pragmatic, iterative, durable, simple, sane, humane, ethical, adaptive, open, social, discriminating, analytical, honest, fair, just, beautiful, graceful, elegant, perfect, evolving, actual, powerful, empirical, reflexive, helpful, utilitarian, hopeful, aspirational, inspirational, objective, honorable, empathetic, reasonable, collaborative, exclusive, inclusive, deliberate, pacific, aggressive...

It’s just a start, but it starts me thinking that all those years of mediocre grades I got in Physical Education were far more consequential than I ever considered.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Sep 3, 2018, 7:51 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">A Certain Formality</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Those who know me best know me to be a formalist. I believe in processes. I believe in collaborative and cumulative human progress. I believe that proper categorization, modification, renovation, and winnowing is fundamental to human existence. I believe this not only as a historical, pragmatic and logical consequence of the human condition. It is the religious and mystical foundation of birur which underlies the Jewish concept of Creation and Salvation.

I also believe that our capacity to act in this manner has been severely disrupted. Various intellectuals I find to be the exceptional thought leaders of our time have emphasized this. Most notably Eric Weinstein speaks of the Intellectual Dark Web, which is a network of people engaged in this type of progress from a manner of social exile. His brother Bret speaks  of a “sense-making apparatus” for humanity. Jordan Peterson speaks of “competence hierarchies.”

All of these are various ways of talking about the mechanisms of human progress. They are speaking of basic breakdowns in academia, politics, mainstream media, the social fabric, etc. These are the mechanisms for disseminating information, identifying problems, recognizing solutions, collective decision making. These are the mechanisms of human progress. They are the vehicles of Redemption.

A fundamental Truth forms the foundations of this worldview. Human beings are finite. No individual is capable of doing everything. No individual can simultaneously be a competent doctor, competent lawyer, competent artists and competent engineer. Human knowledge is too vast and the mental capacity of humans is too limited. If our society is to function, it can only function in collaboration.

A necessary corollary to this finite nature is to grasp the immense scale of society. There are over 6 billion human beings on Earth. Even if you were capable of doing everything, you could not do it for everybody. A single doctor can operate on a single person at a single time. We have achieved amazing scalability in our efforts. Someone makes a video which can entertain millions if not billions of people. But that increase in scale far beyond anything previously available does not make us infinite. It removes some limitations, not all limitations. 

The human beings is fallible. Even the most competent doctor can make a silly mistake. It is thus necessary for even a person who could do all the work by their self to create redundancy. Redundancy is not a waste. Redundancy is a necessity. We must not and cannot create chains which break with individual links.

What we create as human being is necessarily flawed. We must always include a mechanism for further improvement. I believe that this is a fundamental reason all extant religions describe themselves as a path to be followed. While this may surprise some of the most ardent atheists, I don’t know of any religion which holds itself as complete and immutable. 

(While some of the most fundamentalist sects of some religions may arguably hold this tenet, it is truly an extreme position even amongst them. For instance, a belief that Islam was truly Sealed by the Prophet would completely obliterate the necessity for fatwas. Nobody believes that Islam could exist without fatwas.)

Our institutions have completely negated this basic understanding of human limitation. I am constantly faced with people who think they are infallible, immortal, omnipotent and omniscient. Worse yet, I am constantly faced with people who demand that others be infallible, immortal, omnipotent and omniscient. Most tiringly, I find myself dealing with people who do not assume these things to such a fundamental degree that it does not need to be said.

So we end up in the horrible position of both having to admit our limitations in order for people to understand them and simultaneously being dismissed for our limitations. Thus you get the ugliest parts of the Donald, who is both incapable and incapable of acknowledging he is incapable. Should he admit his weakness, he will be dismissed as weak. Since he doesn’t admit weakness, he has fans that proclaim him to be strong.

It should not be necessary to say that you may be wrong. It is a given that you may be wrong. There is no possibility that it is impossible for you to be wrong. To the point where denying the possibility of being wrong is itself proof that you are wrong.

Now go tell the scientist you hold most dear that gravity is “just a theory.” See how they bristle and tell you to take a flying leap to prove it.

The possibility of being wrong does not mean that you are wrong. The possibility that you may fail does not negate your ability to succeed. The imperfection of humanity does not negate its value.

This is where our competence hierarchies have been corrupted and our sense-making apparatus has malfunctioned. This is what has caused our intellectual web to go dark. This is the root of what ails society. We see it every day when someone’s imperfection is used to dismiss them utterly, to dispose of them completely.

We no longer accept apologies. We no longer forgive mistakes. We no longer admit fault. We no longer value growth and humility. We no longer acknowledge that we are finite.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Aug 2, 2018, 6:48 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Fascism, socialism and capitalism</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>We are at a point in our politics where people on the Left brand people on the Right as fascists, then dismiss them. Conservely, people on the Right brand people on the Left as socialists, then dismiss them. This wasn’t as much of a problem when everyone in the United States was what political scientists call “classical liberals.” The American electorate was solidly in the liberal camp, so these brands described ideas that we all rejected.

Our political spectrum has grown. The United States political scene is no longer populated by just liberals. We now have what I would term neo-Marxists, neo-fascists, neo-liberals and neo-feudalists.





The top row is the political spectrum as my Poli Sci 110 professor drew it in 1996. The entirety of the American political spectrum was within what was called liberalism at that time. That was twenty years ago.

The bottom row is how I see our current political spectrum. I am not using these labels pejoratively, I am trying to trace the ideas to the thinkers and systems upon which they were founded. The thoughts espoused by these camps proceed from fundamental value judgments that trace to previous political foundations.

The political thoughts that dominated that previous spectrum no longer dominate. Fascists and socialists were soundly defeated. No country ever claimed communism, except as an ideal. The communists adopted socialism as a stop-gap measure but were defeated.

Feudalism is mostly dead as an ideology, having been replaced by European conservatism. Remember that there are still people who believe monarchy as an institution is desirable. Constitutional monarchies exist all over the world. We are starting to see people on the American right who actually advocate for a type of aristocratic rule. I would call it neo-conservatism instead of neo-feudalism if not for the fact that term is already used to mean something else.

The people who believe in these ideologies don’t call themselves by any of the terms I use. The neo-Marxists call themselves progressives or socialists. The neo-fascists call themselves liberals. The neo-liberals call themselves libertarians. The neo-feudalists call themselves conservatives. I assume almost all of them would bristle at my terminology.

I generally believe we should always call people by what they themselves are willing to label themselves. So, I would not actually use these terms to describe anyone who doesn’t label themselves that way. I am only using the terms I use to identify the historical antecedent for these ideas. 

The truth is that it isn’t fair to paint the new believers of each of the ideologies with the failures of history. All of them have seen the worst excesses of each system that are obvious to us now and adjusted accordingly. That includes rejecting major ideological planks that used to be central parts of the base belief systems. That rejection is itself possibly the most important part of tracing the history of ideas.

But the history of ideas matters. It does matter that each of these ideologies started with something and rejected some of it because of real world consequences. It is important to trace the terms used to the people who first wrote about them. If we are to discuss these ideas, not just dismiss each other pejoratively, we need to be willing to “steel-man” instead of “straw-man” people who disagree with us.

I have been having discussions with people who think this type of historical attribution is a form of guilt by association. I understand that it can be used that way. I don’t think it has to be used that way and I hope that I am not using them that way. Just because someone took the baby out of the bathwater of fascism doesn’t mean we should kill the baby. That would require recognizing that there can be such a thing as a baby in the bathwater of things like fascism, feudalism and Marxism.

As an ardent fan of liberalism, that is not something I am willing to readily concede. The fact is that I think liberalism is better than all of the rest of the ideologies. I also recognize that this requires agreeing with basic principles that I no longer share with my fellow Americans. Most importantly, I believe that the individual is the only unit of citizenship.

Many Americans, maybe even most Americans, no longer agree with that foundational premise of classical liberalism. I personally reject the ideas that descend from them. I don’t want that to imply I think people cannot legitimately hold views which conflict with that premise. That would be illiberal of me.

Everyone is entitled to be wrong. :)</div><div class="_2pic"><table class="uiGrid _51mz" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr class="_51mx"><td class="_51m- pas"><div><a href="photos_and_videos/your_posts/30571972_2116835108603245_5425284566022724469_n_2116835108603245.jpg"><img src="photos_and_videos/your_posts/30571972_2116835108603245_5425284566022724469_n_2116835108603245.jpg" class="_2yuc _3-96" /></a></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 10, 2018, 6:49 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Bullshit!</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I got into a Facebook fight with a friend today, which ended with me defriending him and with him blocking me. Which is always a source of reflection for me. I think as a general rule, nobody is 100% right and nobody 100% wrong. But the fact is that the more I think about it, the more I think that the trouble was simply that I was speaking truthfully about a subject that he was speaking about irresponsibly.

He posted a link to an article that is completely fact-free claiming that “the data” shows the Affordable Care Act caused premiums to go up. Except it offered no data at all. It has a statement regarding unknown analysis which supposedly show things. Without any data whatsoever. None. “These findings come from new data from eHealth.” The link leads to a website’s page where you can buy insurance. No study. No data. Nothing. You might as well click on an advertisement. It has a chart with supposed “computations by HSI, LLC.” 

My friend told me that instead of personal attacks, I should refute the data. Which is usually a very reasonable assertion. If there is data. There is no data here. This is pure garbage masquerading around as analysis. It is an embarrassment to the people who wrote it, the organizations they are affiliated with, the website that published it and anyone who links to it.

I was even more charitable than I needed to be. I tried looking through the website, looked up the authors of the article and tried to find if they published their actual analysis without citing it. Nope. Nothing. There is no there there. What “findings,” what “computations” and what “new data”?!? It is CliffsNotes version of a book that has not been written.

Now, if they HAD provided their data, I am sure I would have ripped it to shreds. Mostly because there can be no “new data” since all the data is already available. It has been for a while. Which is why I have a standing challenge to anyone to come up with any quantitative analysis which shows the situation before Obamacare was better than the situation after Obamacare. It doesn’t exist because it isn’t true. 

You can no more show that than you can show the Earth is flat or that global temperatures have fallen. You can have all kinds of arguments about why global temperatures are rising. You can debate what to do about temperatures rising. You can even debate whether it is good for the temperatures to rise. Nobody who knows anything about it, however, says that the temperatures are not rising. Not the environmentalists and not the skeptics. Nobody.

The same is true of the ACA. Healthcare and health insurance in the United States cost less now than they did before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. You can’t deny that fact because the data is readily available. It has been widely analyzed and the analysis is clear. Which is why nobody refutes it. The Heritage Foundation and CATO institute have been chomping at the bit to criticize Obamacare in every which way. They haven’t published anything because you can’t publish anything because it isn’t true.

I am used to dealing with people misstating the case regarding the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). I am regularly correcting deeply flawed analyses, mostly by amateurs who don’t understand that “healthcare could be so complicated.” The CNN debate on healthcare between Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Bernie Sanders pretty much had me in conniptions. I tried responding but found that I was spending pages just clarifying why individual sentences were misleading.

I feel like saying “it is misleading and your eyes will glaze over if I start to explain why.” I still go ahead and show them why they are wrong, if they are willing to go through all that drudgery. Most people are not and prefer to be ignorant. It is something we have established firmly in our society repeatedly.

What do I do when there isn’t even misleading analysis? Am I supposed to make up some bullshit analysis for these people in order to refute it? This is complete and utter bullshit!

Don’t the people who act so irresponsibly need to be confronted? Should I stop calling bullshit what it is? Have we gotten to a point where we have to put up with a fact-free society? Personal attacks are justified, if the person is doing something that needs to be attacked.

I also have to say that I don’t think it is possible to attack this type of bullshit by being nice about it. Respectful debate has its limitations. There can be no respectful debate when one side is operating on pure bullshit. I can’t refute assertions that are untrue without pointing out that they are false and that the people asserting them are liars. You have to call bullshit what it is or simply give up. Which I refuse to do.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Mar 10, 2018, 2:08 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Truth and Covfefe</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I have been noticing an important disconnect between people who support Donald Trump and people who oppose him. Trump supporters believe that Donald Trump is more honest than the average politician. Trump opponents believe that Donald Trump is less honest than the average politician. I know people who hold one or the other of these beliefs. I see people constantly arguing over this and getting nowhere. I actually believe both arguments are true in their own way.

If you want to change someone’s mind, it is very important to realize why they believe something and what kind of argument would change their minds. People who believe Donald Trump is honest have seen him tell the truth about things that matter to them and lie about things they don’t mind. People who believe Donald Trump is dishonest have seen him lie about things that matter to them and tell the truth about things they don’t care about.

I actually find both arguments convincing. In some ways, Donald Trump is more dishonest than we are used to. In some ways, he is more honest. Allow me to give you some examples.

Let’s start with one of the most obvious sore points for people who oppose Donald Trump. Donald Trump obsessively, repeatedly and unrepentantly kept on repeating the obvious lie that the crowd who attended his inauguration was HUGER than any before. He did this for his HUGEST landslide win of an election in which he got fewer votes than the person he beat. He actually does this a lot. To paraphrase Ben Shapiro, Donald Trump is the type of guy that when he goes to the bathroom always declares he has had the greatest bowel movement in history.

Obvious lies means he is obviously dishonest, right? Wrong!

I have the smartest, cutest, most magnificent and talented nephews in the world. I also have the best dog in the world. My grandmother’s dolmeh is superior to any other dolmeh anyone else has ever made. My friends are the most supportive and caring friends in the world. Also USC is definitely superior to UCLA in every single way, including the fact that its name is not a four letter word.

I obsessively, repeatedly and unrepentantly keep on repeating these facts which some deluded people might find less than objectively verifiable. Does that mean that I am dishonest? No, it doesn’t. You realize that. My nephews realize that. My grandmother realizes that. My friends realize that. Duke, being the best good boy ever, also understands and approves. USC even prints shirts for people to buy with this information and the lying liars at fUCLA print shirts with the opposite assertion. (The only thing worse than having a name that is a four letter word is obviously having a name that is a five letter word starting with f.)

These are things I call partisan lies or favoritism. They are endearing to the favorite. Trump supporters are not going to feel lied to by partisan lies, they are going to feel like Trump cares MORE for them. Which is why Trump obsessively, repeatedly and unrepentantly keeps on telling these lies over and over. Which is why every time you bring up these lies, you get the exact opposite reaction that you would anticipate as someone who is not in the favorite group.

There is also another category of lie that we generally find excusable, which I would call a hypothetical truth. This is when you propose something that you don’t actually know to be true or even know not to be true, but do it for a specific purpose. We actually expect lawyers and other advocates to engage in this type of dishonesty. Is a criminal defense attorney lying when he proposes something as a possibility in order to introduce reasonable doubt despite knowing for a fact that it isn’t true? These are the “alternative facts” that Kellyanne Conway made famous. You propose something that someone may think is true, even if you don’t believe it yourself. The key characteristic of this untruth is that it furthers a cause you do believe in. These are the types of lies that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are constantly engaging in to my consternation and their supporters are constantly defending.

When I was in law school, I went to a debate about a coming Presidential election between someone from the People for the American Way and someone from the Reason Foundation. They were talking about the possibilities of the Supreme Court becoming more conservative leading to abortion becoming illegal in California. I pointedly asked the lawyer from People for the American Way if she really believed that anything could cause abortion to become illegal in California. She pointedly responded that it was not only possible but likely, which everyone in the room found hilariously absurd. When the guy from Reason asked if we thought it was possible, we all laughed. 

Was she being dishonest? I think so. I also think calling her organization People for the American Way is dishonest. What does that make everyone who disagrees with them? Am I not a person for the “American Way?” Am I person against the “American Way?” But I admit that I don’t find calling a libertarian advocacy group “Reason” nearly as objectionable. 

This type of dishonesty is not only excused, it is something most people think you should expect from an advocate. Do you think Trump supporters are going to be offended that he acts as an advocate for something they believe in? They haven’t yet and I don’t see why they would start now.

Now, let us consider the most egregious form of lie we are all very familiar with: the campaign promise. We expect politicians to make all sorts of campaign promises but not to keep them. For instance, Presidents have promised to move the United States embassy to Jerusalem for decades. They were lying. It was very clear they were lying. We all know they were lying. They knew they were lying. Nobody seriously thought they would keep their promise. The world was shocked when Donald Trump actually tried to fulfill that promise, just as so many were shocked he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and has started to build his wall.

Take for instance the Democratic National Committee saying that they could have picked the Presidential nominee in a smoke filled room if they had wanted to. The DNC lawyers actually argued in court that since they had made a “political promise” it would be silly to hold them to it. Bernie Sanders supporters were, in my opinion quite rightly, incensed by the argument.

Which is where Trump’s “honesty” resides for his supporters. He is treating his political promises as a real obligation. He is actually trying to fulfill his promises, many of which even his supporters argued should not be taken literally. Many a pundit, more than a few lawyers and courts around the country have had to deal with the novel concept that Donald Trump is a politician who takes his campaign promises seriously. The most important part of the honesty equation here is that these promises actually have real consequences in the lives of the people who care about them. These are promises that voters relied upon when they voted.

So, if you want to persuade someone who doesn’t already believe Donald J. Trump is dishonest, consider what kind of lie you are accusing him of telling. Are you accusing him of lying about something completely inconsequential that endears him to his fans like the size of his crowds? Save your breath. Are you accusing him of lying about something that would be convenient to his supporters if it were true like the possibility of abortions in California being illegal? Save your breath. Are you accusing him of lying to them about something they care about? Good! Because that is the only type of honesty they are likely to care about.

If you really want, feel free to argue what the standard for honesty should be. Just be aware that the vast majority of people will simply tune you out because that is a level of abstraction most people don’t care to even consider.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Dec 12, 2017, 2:57 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Invisible data</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I call this Jacob’s Theory of Invisible Data. If someone else has come up with it before or has a better name, I appreciate you letting me know.

Given that: 

1) Data is readily available to an entity 

2) The data could support a particular conclusion 

3) That conclusion is beneficial to the entity that has access to that data 

4) There is public interest in the data

5) That data is not available to the public

We can assume that there exists data to refute the conclusion. The data is not visible, but we can tell it is there.

For example, let us say you go to a website that provides a service. The price of that service is not visible on the website. You can assume that the service provider knows its price and is withholding that information because you wouldn’t like it. They could just put their prices on the Internet in most cases.

Here is a perfect example. This website sells emergency rations. Nowhere on its website can you find the ingredients of those rations. They obviously know what the ingredients of their food is. You can assume that the list of ingredients would make you not want to buy.

Another example is the lack of information about how earnings are affected by getting a college degree controlled by the income of parents. The Department of Education collects data on every student with a student loan, which is a huge data set. The data includes how much the parents of students earn, what colleges the students attend, which degrees they receive and the earnings of the student while repaying the loan. It could easily release an aggregate of that data. But it doesn’t. We can assume that the data points to the earnings potential of people controlled by their parents’s earnings.

There are many more examples. You do have to make certain assumptions. Is the data really readily available? Is there public interest in that data? Can that data be made available to the public? Someone might say that nobody cares about controlling the effects of a college education by the earnings of the student’s parents. Or that it is difficult to access the data. 

I also debated adding a caveat as to whether the data can be made public. You might argue that there are privacy concerns or legal barriers. I don’t think that is really valid, because I believe a motivated entity would find a way to overcome any such barrier. If the barriers cannot be overcome by the entity with access to it, you have to reconsider which entity it is that is creating those barriers. 

For instance, the American Medical Association and American Bar Association are adamantly opposed to price transparency. They have created barriers to advertising your prices. You can assume that this is because the availability of the data would change your conclusion to the detriment of the AMA or ABA.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Nov 14, 2017, 1:56 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Me, too.</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I really wasn’t going to join this whole “me, too” meme for many reasons. I really don’t think that I should need to have lived an experience in order to speak about it intelligently. We human beings are capable of empathy and communication. We can learn about and comprehend the experience of others. I am no fan of anecdotal evidence or confirmation bias. I generally think my friends don’t need to personally know someone in order to realize that person exists. People exist regardless of whether you have met them and you should acknowledge their presence without needing to be friends with them.

Then I heard someone respond to Terry Crews coming forward with something idiotic like “if it can happen to someone like him...” Which was infuriating, but I guess understandable. 

Then, I made a comment on Facebook that sexual assault isn’t a gendered problem. Which got an immediate response from someone who said “it certainly happens to one gender more than the other.”

And the word “certainly” just made me want to break something.

Certainly? Really? Certainly? How certain are you? How exactly are you certain?

Certainly!

We certainly don’t know the exact numbers of assault victims. We are certain that the number of male sexual assault victims is not small. I can only guess that someone who would make such an ignorant statement might be surprised that the number is likely at least 1 in 5. We are also certain that many men do not come forward because certain people are so certain that only certain types of people are likely to be assaulted.

If you take only one thing away from reading this, please let it be this: Sexual assault is certainly not about the victim. Sexual assault is about the perpetrator. That is certain. And every time you make it about the victim, you are certainly making the situation worse. You can be certain of that.

When you assume that sexual assault can only happen to some people, you place the experience of people who are not in that category into doubt. You make it harder for victims to step forward. It isn’t that sexual assault can happen to someone like Terry Crews. It is that someone like Terry Crews can step forward and describe his experience without having his masculinity challenged. 

Making sexual assault about gender also makes it harder for women to step forward. It entwines the position of being assaulted with being a woman and being weak. No one should feel that coming forward with an allegation of sexual assault is a display of weakness. We do talk about it in that way. We call it a complaint, as if a better person would just ignore it. We denigrate the position of victims and the need to feel safe. We ridicule people for being victims. We implicitly question whether a woman who complains is tough enough to handle the same things men can. It implies that being assaulted is some sort of female failing.

Coming forward with allegations of sexual assault is not a feminine or masculine thing to do. It is a strong, not weak, thing to do. It shows moral fortitude, personal responsibility and self-esteem to stand up against an injustice. It shows a conviction that we deserve to be treated well. We have a right to the protection society owes us and we have earned by virtue of our humanity. Not as men or women, but as human beings.

So do me a favor and don’t be so certain who is a victim of sexual assault. We don’t know. We don’t know precisely because other people make it hard for victims to step forward. It becomes a source of shame and fear. It focuses attention on the person who was assaulted, where it does not belong. 

The focus should always be on the perpetrator. The allegation is about the perpetrator. The innocence or guilt depends on the actions of the perpetrator. The criminal intent depends on the state of mind of the perpetrator. The culpability of the perpetrator is aggravated or mitigated by the history of the perpetrator. The malice, guilt and shame of the situation belong to the perpetrator.

I am eternally grateful to my many great friends and family who have always been supportive of me. I was very young when I was raped. (Yes, rape of a child is “rape rape.”) My parents, grandparents and family did the best they could with a very flawed justice system in a very flawed country. I don’t need to come forward for myself and I don’t need anyone’s else’s sympathy. This isn’t news to the people who have known me the longest. I proudly get plenty of sympathy from the many people who care for me. That is what friends are for.

But I want my broader circle of acquaintances to understand that sexual assault is not a gendered problem. It is not just something that just happens to women. There is no shame in being assaulted. I did nothing wrong and I know I did nothing wrong. If anything, my parents have felt more guilt than they deserve. It wasn’t their fault either.

So, here we are. Me, too. I hope that breaks certain illusions certain people may have about what it means to be sexually assaulted.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Oct 16, 2017, 1:10 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">On socialism</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>We have a tendency in the United States to throw around the word socialist as a pejorative. People often bring it up for no good reason in order to shut down real conversation about real issues. I don’t use the term socialism as a pejorative.  I have taken the time to consider and reject it as an ideology as inherently evil.

Socialism has been defined, refined and implemented. It is not the &quot;socialist policies&quot; that people often refers to when talking about normal policies in the United States. Nor are social democrats the same thing as democratic socialism. Social democracy is its own ideology that was referred to as Neo-Fascism by actual  socialists. The term &quot;democratic socialist&quot; is redundant since all socialists profess the need for democracy. Marx lived in the United Kingdom after all and he was addressing the problems with that society.

So I hope you understand that I would not say &quot;socialism and communism are evil&quot; out of simple prejudice. I am a classical liberal, a label I have chosen for myself. Until very recently, the whole of the American political spectrum was contained in what was referred to in Europe as simply &quot;liberal.&quot; American conservatives, unlike European conservatives, never wanted to retain an aristocratic rule since we never had it. Only recently has European conservatism arrived on our shores with certain reactionary movements.

Real socialism is based in the actual belief that individual property rights are not legitimate. A socialist society, as has been tried many times, does not protect private property rights at all. As the maxim goes, &quot;from each according to his ability and to each according to his need.&quot; Liberalism, as opposed to socialism, recognizes private property rights. We believe that the proper unit of rights is not society, but rather the individual. This is a belief that is unique to liberalism, as opposed to the various other ideologies including fascism and socialism.

Social democracy (which is in fact a descendant of fascism, although it is unfair to label them neo-fascists) rejects this idea as well. But social democracy rejects it in a completely different way than socialism based on Christianity where it has its roots. You will notice that many social democrat parties in Europe use the term Christian in their name.

Of course, there is no such a thing as a pure government or pure implementation of an ideology. Every real example falls short of its ideals. But I strongly believe in individual rights. I reject socialism in that it rejects what I view as basic human rights of private property. Simply having a social contract where people agree to act in concert is not a negation of individual rights. This is a major reason why liberal societies believe in the right to emigrate as a fundamental right. If I don&#039;t like how society is being run, I can take my ball and go home. This is not acknowledged as a right by socialists, since they don&#039;t believe that I have a right to call it &quot;my ball&quot; at all.

In the context of liberalism, greed is not an evil. It is simply an expression of human identity. Which is something you implicitly agree to if you think that doctors or nurses should be paid more for their work than anyone else. 

There are court cases currently going on in Brazil over the rights of Cuban doctors. I highly recommend you look into the situation and decide which argument you agree with. Different courts have ruled in different ways, which indicates that it isn&#039;t a simple issue. It is not prejudice or bigotry to take one of the two sides in that very real situation. 

As a liberal, I believe that the doctors have the right to their own labor and the state should not enforce what is essentially slavery on them. I view that is an intrinsic evil. A true socialist believes that the doctors owe their income to the society which gave them their education and possibilities. 

That is not a straw man. That is what socialists believe. Which is why I can say socialism is evil. A socialist would not disagree with my characterization of their position. I am not caricaturing their beliefs. They actually believe that these doctors should be forced to return to Cuba or to pay their salaries to the Cuban government.

I believe that to be evil. I believe these doctors have the right to emigrate, the right to their labor and a right to stop working for the government of Cuba. A socialist equally believes my ideas to be evil as they believe it would be theft from the people of Cuba. These are inherently contradictory ways of seeing right and wrong.

I would just point that societies based on liberalism have shown themselves to be the ones people immigrate to. Societies that are based on socialism have shown themselves to be disasters, perpetrated mass murder and become situations that people flee from. In that way, I believe the human experience shows my beliefs to be right and socialists to be wrong.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Oct 3, 2017, 8:06 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Jimmy Kimmel and the Devil in the Details</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Jimmy Kimmel, like almost everyone else who talks publicly about healthcare policy, gets his facts wrong. When I point to specific facts, I get accused of using technicalities to mislead and saying his facts are wrong when I just disagree. I am not trying to mislead. I don’t disagree with Kimmel. I don’t have opinions on fantasy worlds that don’t resemble reality. 

The details are important. They are important for implementing policy and they are important for making broad moral judgments. Having a policy debate with false facts is beyond useless, it is detrimental.

This is a redacted version of a conversation I had about it yesterday with someone who obviously understands the actual system and problems.

Me:   We do not have a system where people are denied healthcare because of their inability to pay. That is one of the primary causes of what you rightly point out. We pay more for healthcare than any other country.

 

Response:  You&#039;re using technicalities to mislead. We may not have a system where people are explicitly denied healthcare because of their inability to pay, but we absolutely have a system where people die because they cannot afford the healthcare they&#039;re offered--to the tune of about 45,000 per year pre-Obamacare, according to a Harvard study. People do choose to forego essential medication, tests and follow-ups because of the cost burden, and it kills them (or sends them to the emergency room when they have a catastrophic incident, the cost burden of which must be eaten by the institution, driving up health care costs). 



This is the crux of my frustration with the debate that is being generated by Kimmel’s speech. Kimmel is arguing that no one should be denied healthcare because they can’t afford it. His detractors are responding that he is making an emotional appeal, by which they really mean that someone has to ultimately pay for the healthcare that Kimmel would like to see everyone receive. We then get into a whole discussion about societal values with which I am sure you are familiar.

Fiscal conservatives will point out that someone has to pay for this stuff. Fiscal liberals will demand that we pay for it. The conservatives will assert that the liberals are talking about fanciful things that cannot exist. They refuse to adopt a system where they have to pay for everyone else. The liberals will assert that the conservatives have no heart. They don’t want a system where people are dying on the streets. Nobody convinces anybody.

But that whole debate is completely moot and irrelevant. Once again, the truth is that we do not currently have a system where people are denied healthcare because of their inability to pay. We have not had such a system for decades. The options being discussed are not options and the values being advocated are not at issue.

Allow me to add my own anecdotal story to the mix. I received a call from a man who is a relatively affluent professional, did not have insurance and had just been diagnosed with cancer. Contrary to popular belief, you still cannot wait until you need health insurance to buy it. He was scared that he would not be able to get treatment.

I spent the next two hours on the phone reassuring him that he was not going to be denied treatment, as there are several ways in which he can go bankrupt. It wasn’t exactly reassuring to be told you are going to lose everything you own, including possibly your job. It was still more reassuring than being told he was going to die. Once you have no job and no money, you will definitely qualify for Medicaid as people have for decades. 

There are also a few other options which were more commonly used before Obamacare, but still come to the same result. You will get the medical treatment to save your life, you will just lose everything you own. Before Obamacare, this could still be true for people who were insured. Cancer might not kill you, but it would bankrupt you either way.

The important thing is that the actual healthcare is never refused! This reality has real world consequences which escape Kimmel and almost everyone else having this discussion. We don’t have a system in which people actually get refused service. We have a system where you may have to become poor in order to get service. The fear of becoming poor leads to the additional costs and deaths in the cited Harvard study. The results are not surprising when you have an accurate picture of the system as a whole.

Many conservatives seem to think it is impossible to provide these services to everyone, because we cannot afford it. The opposite is true, nobody is refused and government mandates mean that we must pay for it. Many liberals seem to think that our system refuses healthcare to people who cannot afford it. The opposite is true, nobody is refused and government mandates that we must pay for it. The whole debate is based on false premises.

Which brings us to talking points which boggle the mind. 

Republicans have their talking points. Obamacare has mostly expanded the number of covered people by expanding Medicaid. People who are covered by Medicaid have similar results to people who are uninsured. 

Democrats have their talking points. We now spend less money “all dollars in” on healthcare than we did before Obamacare. The United States spends twice as much on healthcare as other countries but get similar results. 

These talking points are honest facts that should not surprise someone with an accurate picture of our healthcare system. The “uninsured” are actually covered by Medicaid already! Just because you throw them off the Medicaid rolls does not make these people disappear. These people still get care and our invisible system for paying for that care is incredibly inefficient. It has unintended results that drive up costs. Having more people actually enrolled in the official healthcare system reduces costs because transparent costs are more effectively managed.

Jimmy Kimmel is not a hero. He is just one more person talking about a system he does not understand. It doesn’t matter whether you agree or disagree with what he says because it doesn’t reflect reality. Which doesn’t make him evil. It just makes him yet another voice muddying the waters and another obstacle to repairing our broken system.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Sep 22, 2017, 2:45 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Cost Share Reductions in Obamacare</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Cost Share Reduction (CSR) is an important part of Obamacare that is arcane, very important and a ticking time-bomb. I’m going to attempt to explain it as simply as possible, in case you are interested. I am only going to talk about healthy adults who are not offered health insurance by any other means.

Obamacare was set up with two types of assistance to people buying health insurance. How much and what type of assistance you receive is based on your own estimate for your tax filing household’s income. That income is compared to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), giving you a percentage. Everyone who estimates their income at 100% or less of FPL qualifies for Medicaid, which is completely free. In the States that expanded Medicaid, this number goes up to 138%.

People who estimate their income at 139% to 400% of FPL get a tax credit that is based on the price of the second cheapest Silver tier plan (called the benchmark plan). Obamacare sets the threshold for affordability of premiums at 9.5% of income. The Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) is calculated to allow the consumer to buy the benchmark plan by paying 9.5% of their income. It can be applied to any plan available on the official marketplace and pay the difference as long as it is at least $1 per person per month. So if a consumer buys a cheaper plan, they might pay a lot less. I have clients in their sixties who are receiving over $10k in APTC even though Los Angeles is one of the cheapest healthcare markets in the country.

In January, each consumer receives a Form 1095A that states how much APTC that household received, the premium of the plan they bought and the price of the benchmark plan. If the estimated income was below the actual income filed, the taxpayer has to pay back any extra APTC up to certain maximums based on income.  If the estimated income was above the actual income, the taxpayer receives the amount they should have received. If the actual income was so low that they should have received Medicaid instead of APTC, the taxpayer has to pay back the whole amount up to the maximum amount.

The second type of assistance is the Cost Share Reduction. Cost sharing refers to deductibles, copays and coinsurance of an insurance policy. It is all the money other than the premium that the policyholder is expected to pay for their healthcare. Cost sharing is a mechanism used in insurance to reduce morale hazard, which greatly increases costs. Morale hazard is actually one of the biggest problems in our health care market, if not the biggest problem. That is why larger deductibles are actually a good thing and why the most free-market friendly proposal has been Health Savings Accounts as an incentive for people to buy high deductible plans.

The essential problem of cost sharing is that it must be high enough to cause the consumer to try to reduce costs while it is low enough to be affordable. If cost sharing is too high, consumers will avoid healthcare which will also increase costs. If cost sharing is too low, as is usually the case with almost all health insurance plans in the United States, it drives up costs for everyone dramatically. Obamacare addressed this problem in two ways: all preventive care is set at $0 cost sharing and CSRs.

Consumer who estimate their income at 139% to 150% of FPL gain access to buy Silver 94 plans. These are plans that are priced the same as the Silver plan by the same insurance company, but have cost sharing that is far superior to any Platinum plan available. From 150% to 200% of FPL, the consumer can buy a Silver 87 plan, which is similar to a Platinum plan. From 200% to 250% of FPL, the consumer can buy a Silver 73 plan which has very similar cost sharing to a normal Silver plan that has a normal Actuarial Value (AV) of 70.

The CSR has multiple problems, including the fact that it cannot be adjusted retroactively if people estimate their income incorrectly. Even very rich people can estimate their income low enough to purchase a Silver 94 plan and then only pay back the APTC they received. People who did not have access to Medicaid or a CSR but deserved it never get the extra money they spent back.

The CSR also has the problem that Congress never allocated funds to pay for it. President Obama and now President Trump are spending money that was never allocated to pay for it, which is a grotesque abuse of the Constitution and Congress. But since it was President Obama doing it, nobody really paid attention. The people on the right already had their hands full with the other grotesque abuses of the Constitution by President Obama. The people on the left were cheering Emperor Obama on.

But now, people on the right and left agree that we should not allow President Trump to abuse the Constitution like President Obama did. If the government suddenly stops paying for the CSRs, insurance companies are going to take a huge hit. Not only are they owed money, but CSRs are income sensitive ways of reducing morale hazard. That means CSRs help lower premiums for everyone in a way that we simply could not do in an unregulated market. Reducing morale hazard with income appropriate cost sharing requires basing cost sharing on the consumer’s income. How do you do that outside of a government program like Obamacare?

CSRs have other problems as well, which I won’t go into. Getting rid of CSRs completely might not be a horrible idea. There are other proposals available and possible. But that would require Congress to pass laws tweaking Obamacare and funding it. Obamacare has come in MASSIVELY under budget, has been wildly successful by any quantitative measure you want to try and is possibly the best thing to happen to the United States in decades. People on the left want to get rid of it because they are wedded to the incredibly bad idea of single payer. People on the right want to get rid of it because they are wedded to the incredibly bad idea of partisanship.

If payments for CSRs stop, the individual health insurance markets will take a hit. Just the uncertainty of whether CSRs will be paid makes premiums go up. Partisans on both sides of the political spectrum seem to like that just fine.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Aug 1, 2017, 6:39 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Insurance and poverty</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Insurance serves many functions, despite what the average person thinks. One key thing that insurance does is allow poor people to have things that would otherwise be restricted to rich people. Take driving a car for example. If you want to drive in California, you have three options. You can either show proof of insurance, post a bond* for $35k or post $35k cash with the DMV.

There are roughly 25 million drivers in California. That means that in order for Californians to drive without insurance companies, they would have to cough up a collection $875 billion. But we know that the vast majority of drivers are not going to have accidents and we know that most accidents don’t approach costing $35k. Which is where insurance comes in. A large number of people have a small probability of a large loss, which means that this is a perfect environment for insurance to function.

Instead of requiring each Californian to put up the money to cover their possible liabilities, we can allow an insurer to post a much smaller reserve. Insurance companies can credibly promise to pay up to the $875 billion, while not actually having $875 billion and knowing that the probability of paying the full amount is negligible.

This is what also allowed relatively wealthy people to buy risky operations before Obamacare. I am talking about risky to the hospital, not risky to the patient here. Imagine that you have no health insurance, are relatively wealthy and need a hip replacement. A hip replacement costs roughly $40k. But it is major surgery and major surgeries have all types of risk. If you go into a hospital for a $40k hip replacement, you have a real risk of having a $1 million or more hospital bill when you are able to walk out.

So hospitals are not willing to let people without health insurance just pay for a hip replacement. Before Obamacare required individual plans to be guaranteed issue, there was** only one work around. Really rich people would establish a business, even going so far as hiring employees if necessary and buy an expensive guaranteed issue group policy to cover them. Insurance companies understood what was going on here. This also happened a lot with maternity coverage.

This is one of the reasons that healthcare is such a perfect market for insurance to empower financial reach. The possible financial liability is much higher than the probable financial liability. The mechanism of insurance allows people who can pay the probable financial liability to enter situations that would be prohibitive if they were required to show proof that they can meet the possible liability.

It allows people who don’t have have $35k to drive. It allows people who don’t have $1 million to get hip replacements and have babies. It allows us as Californians to be assured that people with cars will pay for the damages they cause. It allowed hospitals to stay in the business of hip replacements and maternity, even before Obamacare.

*A bond is a surety, not insurance, issued by an insurance company. The difference between an insurance and a bond is subrogation. I could get into it, if you want, but most people don’t care.

Insurance is deceptively complex and he made me realize that much of what I try to express about it both assumes people know things that they don’t and includes conclusions that seem to be completely out of nowhere or counter-intuitive. I ended up wondering how it could be that I was lecturing him specifically on economics as it relates to healthcare, when my guess would have been that he is one of my friends who knows most about the subject.

Our President recently made a remark that has been rightfully mocked, “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” Comedians have been remarking that everybody knew health care could be so complicated, which I believe is equally untrue. Many people who have a solid grasp of most other policies really have no idea how complex the subject is in our particular economy. I especially came to that particular conclusion when I figured out that a major part of the reason I was disagreeing with a different friend was that he thought two very different types of insurance were related. To me, it very much felt like we were arguing about tracks and I suddenly realized I was talking about deer tracks and he was talking about train tracks.

If you take nothing else away from everything else I say regarding healthcare, please understand this: 

We are experiencing real failures of the healthcare market.

I am not in any way joking. This is not, like some people think, that the free market is working as it should or would with brutal capitalism. That is a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation we find ourselves in. 

The inability to access affordable healthcare in the United States is in fact worse than less developed countries with weaker social safety nets. If you need proof of this, just consider the fact that Americans are traveling abroad to get their healthcare. I have had multiple veterinarians remark that the healthcare available to our pets is cheaper with comparable (or superior!) quality. 

Remember the pictures of people with money standing in lines to buy bread from shops with empty shelves? We do, in fact, have a similar situation. 

The healthcare market, not just the health insurance market, is failing. Anyone who has a simple solution to such a complex problem is a simpleton. There is no solution to this problem that takes less than a book worth of knowledge to understand. There is no description of this problem that takes less than a book worth of explanation.

We have a situation where people with money to cover the relevant costs cannot purchase the healthcare that we have the means to produce. For any market to function, you must have a system where consumers agree to exchange value with producers. That does not exist. Even with $1,000,000 in the bank, you have no ability to approach a healthcare provider to purchase a non-emergency course of treatment that costs under $100,000. I am not posing hypotheticals, I am describing the situation of multiple clients. You simply cannot do it because the market is failing.

When you do not have a market, supply cannot change with demand. Prices do not react to the balance of supply and demand. Prices do not rise with the increase of demand. Demand does not rise or fall with change in price. Supply does not rise with the increase in price. Surplus supply cannot be sold at a discount. Consumers and suppliers are both unable to make proper adjustments. Not to mention that profiteers unjustly abuse a market failure in ways that would never exist in normal conditions.

This is partially (and only partially!) caused by the fact that we currently use insurance to finance the provision of health care. My wealthy clients with their millions in the bank did in fact get their procedures. But they did it in the only way available, which is to buy insurance to cover a cost that had already been incurred. That is not how insurance works. Once again, I feel it necessary to reiterate that I am not posing hypotheticals. I am telling you what multiple clients have had to do in order to pay for non-emergency medical procedures that they can afford under normal market conditions.

Insurance is a mechanism that helps to reduce and finance certain types of risk in certain situations. Insurance cannot and should not be used as a mechanism to procure services. We would also have market failures if we bought our food, our clothing or our housing with insurance.

That doesn’t mean insurance is the problem. Healthcare is unique as a commodity. That is why it responds better than most other situations to being partially financed by health insurance in certain situations. But this is not a problem caused by insurance by itself. Without health insurance, we would have market failures like those that are plaguing Canada’s system which bans insurance. Anyone who points to any other country as if a clear solution has presented itself and is hiding in plain sight is a conspiracy theorist. The whole of our political and economic system is not being controlled by some sort of cabal that is able to so clearly delude so many people or bar such a clear path forward.

Remember that food is also a commodity that was often considered too important to be left to the market. Think of how much more often the threat of starvation appeared in fiction. Think of how much more controlled the food market is today than almost any other commodity. We have gotten to a point in developed nations that obesity is a greater threat to our health than malnutrition. That was not always the case.

I personally do not believe that needs to be the case with healthcare either. We have gotten to a point where over-utilization and the misdistribution of healthcare is a real problem. It is an untrue assumption of most people that if healthcare were completely free, it would be consumed in infinite quantities. How many medically necessary and advisable procedures would you have, if money were no object? Unless you are are living with crushing debt and almost no luxuries whatsoever, it is probably the exact same amount as you have right now! You are far more likely to consume nearly infinite food than you are to consume nearly infinite medicine, even towards the end of your life.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Mar 19, 2017, 6:09 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Transparent pricing for medical procedures</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>This is what I am thinking of proposing to the National Association of Health Underwriters as kind of patient’s bill of rights regarding pricing.

4) No provider of healthcare shall order any non-emergency procedure or service from another provider without the prior consent of the person who would be financially liable. No in-network provider may order procedures from an out-of-network provider without prior, written consent.

5) Every insurance policy with out-of-network coverage shall publish on the World Wide Web a complete list of their covered  services with the appropriate billing code and price in a format to be determined by the CMS. In lieu of such listing, an insurer may designate the percentage of the CMS designated Physician Fee Schedule that it will pay.

There are also ridiculous proposals and ineffectual proposals.

Absurd proposals:

These are proposals that don’t actually have any possibility of being enacted in the United States. The people who propose them may be silly, but I suspect they are just dishonest. These proposals include single-payer and a full repeal of Obamacare without a replacement. To quote from the Heritage Foundation when they were still sane (1989), “ If a young man wrecks his Porsche and has not had the foresight to obtain insurance, we may commiserate, but society feels no obligation to repair his car. But health care is different. If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance. “

Ineffectual proposals:

There seems to be some temptation to throw the dog a bone by mentioning really small tweaks that are unlikely to have a significant effect on things. The current Republican pet is Health Savings Accounts. We already have Health Savings Accounts. Similarly, people talk about removing the individual mandate as if it is nearly as important as the subsidies. To quote from Cato’s latest (admittedly completely self-contradictory and silly) proposal, the tax credits are “more coercive” (emphasis in the original) than the individual mandate. Every time someone mentions keeping 25 year olds on their parents’s insurance, my eyes become just a little more likely to roll straight out of my head. Do you really think insurance companies don’t want to insure more 25 year olds? Lots of small ideas do not make a good substitute for institutional reform.

Real proposals:

The Heritage Foundation has apparently found the wisdom of automatic enrollment. I suspect there would be riots all over red states if such a thing were proposed, but that does seem to be an actual solution. If you do not buy insurance, the government will buy it for you and charge you when you file your taxes. What will the government buy? The most likely candidate is a public option.

Paul Ryan and others have started talking about the government stepping up and paying for the things it mandates. The fact is that we passed “universal healthcare” under Reagan as the EMTALA. Every emergency room in the country must treat people for “free.” That is absurd, of course. Nobody is treating anyone for “free,” the costs are being shifted invisibly. Stepping up and paying those costs honestly will reduce horrible distortion that this type of shifting causes.

Speaker Ryan also proposed getting rid of the problem that created our current situation in the first place: the employer tax deduction for health insurance. He stopped speaking about it pretty quick, so I can’t imagine it will happen. It would be likely to improve the situation dramatically, especially if combined with opt-out automatic enrollment. Employer based health insurance is the root cause of our problems, as acknowledged by essentially everyone with the least modicum of honesty. I have a hard time seeing the Chamber of Commerce allowing that.

Conservatives are also apparently warming up to the federal regulation of insurance. They will not say so. The House Freedom Caucus is claiming it wants more state control, while simultaneously proposing interstate competition and an end to the anti-trust exemption for health insurance. Obamacare’s failures in this light were caused by the lack of political will to do it with enough force. I assume the same will continue. You can’t have true interstate competition along with a patchwork of state regulations.

Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz are leading a charge against the pharmaceutical industry by allowing drug importation from other countries. That will allow consumers to get around the ridiculously stringent standards of the FDA imposed by crony-capitalism.

The only part of the bill proposed this week that I did like was an attempt to move towards “voucherizing” Medicaid. Medicare is already well on its way to becoming voucherized. The most recent statistics I saw said that 31% of Medicare beneficiaries are using Medicare Advantage and that number keeps on growing. (That is, essentially, using Medicare vouchers instead of Original Medicare.)

An idea that I have only seen batted around by members of the National Association of Health Underwriters is to require every healthcare provider to create a website listing all the services they offer by the billing code and how much they charge for that. I cannot imagine the American Medical Association would allow such a thing, but it is nice to dream.

This saying is used to show that blame does not completely reside in one side of an equation. Which is what I always think about when people talk about illegal immigration and immigrants. It takes two to tango. The illegal immigrants are not here randomly. They are not deluding employers who hire them.

Andrew Puzder is just the latest super-wealthy person to get caught hiring an illegal immigrant. He certainly isn’t the first person, but it is even more galling that he is a nominee for Labor Secretary by Donald “Another Brick in the Wall” Trump. Contrast Puzder with  Guadalupe García de Rayos who was deported last week years after she pled guilty to a “class 6” felony and served time in jail.

It takes two to tango, but I haven’t read about her employers being charged with anything. They were required to start using the e-Verify system. Which really seems like an extension of the tango metaphor to me.

It takes two to tango. Except one person is wearing high-heels, a dress and long hair. She is the one being constantly thrown around and having to land on her feet while the guy “leads.” She is the one who takes the risks and he gets just as much of the rewards? Seems pretty ridiculous to me.

I am all for law and order. I have no rebuttal to the argument that a nation’s sovereignty includes control of its borders. I came here as a refugee and I am very grateful. I personally know a handful of people who are waiting to enter the United States legally. There are many, many more. I am sympathetic to the argument that we should take care of ourselves first and worry about others second. Charity cannot override responsibility.

But let’s be fair here. Who is more to blame? The people fleeing horrible circumstances who come here at great personal risk to take difficult jobs at what can only be described as slave wages? Or the super-rich people whose shoes and handbags cost more than a month of the salary they are willing to pay their nannies? Or the owners of the restaurants who hire them to work in the kitchen? Or the farmers who, much like the Antebellum plantation owners, complain that they must have cheap labor?

Yes. It takes two to tango. But it takes a “class 6” jerk to lay all the blame at the feet of the person who is wearing the high heels.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Feb 13, 2017, 5:58 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">A New Year Resolution</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I would like to propose a New Year resolution that I think is not so difficult. All it requires is being aware of suicide contagion and trying not to help it spread.

Suicide contagion is real. You can help!

1) Do not portray suicide as a natural response to anything.

Way too often, I hear people explaining away suicides. They make it sound like it is the only way to deal with bullying or some other trauma. It is not! A healthy person will not respond to even the worst situations with suicide. People who are suicidal tend to be mentally ill, which will get better with treatment.

2) Do not trivialize or dramatize mental illness.

Mental illness is an illness like any other major illness.  It is caused by genetics, chemicals, viruses, physical dysfunction, etc. It requires treatment from a professional. The mental health industry has made amazing advances in the past 30 years. We live in an age where amazing pharmaceuticals and scientifically proven treatments are available. Electroconvulsive therapy, hypnosis and psychotherapy have come a long way. I highly recommend anyone under the age of 40 spend a nice long time speaking about mental illness treatment with someone over the age of 60. When I was a teenager, it was rare that someone with a major illness like schizophrenia could be treated. The medications available at the time were highly toxic and had ghastly side effects. That simply isn’t true any more.

3) Celebrate life, not death.

It is common to emphasize how someone died instead of how that person lived. This can spread suicide contagion. When someone dies from suicide and mental illness, the suicide is not the sum total of that person’s life. It isn’t even the sum total of that person’s death. Robin Williams was a brilliant comedian and actor who struggled with depression and addiction. He lost that struggle. That doesn’t mean he is now at peace, it means we are all diminished by his loss. It doesn’t really matter how he died, it matters what he was able to accomplish before he died.

You can read more about suicide contagion, mental illness, etc. on your own. One website I highly recommend for everyone, regardless of mental health status, is Mood GYM. It is a proven set of exercises that prevents mental illness by helping us to confront thought patterns that can aggravate it.

To say that this is the billion dollar question is to vastly underestimate its import. The healthcare industry approaches $2 trillion. Over the past 6 years, the industry has changed dramatically. Mostly in ways that the average American has no clue about. During this time, I have been carefully considering every proposal being floated. This isn’t hard. There aren’t any real proposals out there that would be a replacement of Obamacare. Not a single political campaign, think tank or policy wonk has floated an intelligible proposal.

It is hard to know what lawmakers mean when they say they will repeal Obamacare because they don’t know they are talking about. What is Obamacare? If you can’t tell me what it is, then how are you going to repeal and replace it?

So, I am going to go over some of the things people mean by Obamacare.

1) Guaranteed Issue - This is the idea that you cannot reject people with a pre-existing condition. Trump has already said that he will retain it. It is wildly popular, drives up the cost of insurance by a lot and is very complicated.

2) Individual mandate - This is the penalty for not having health insurance. The fact is that the individual mandate honestly has no teeth. It was effective in getting people to look at their options. Some people were fined relatively small sums. People who criticize it still have no answer to the essential question of how they intend to pay all the doctors and hospitals who are forced to eat the bill when someone without insurance comes for emergency services.   Every state in the Union has laws that prohibit refusing treatment to people who cannot pay. These people end up declaring bankruptcy or just ignoring the bad credit until it falls off their report. But forcing doctors to work for free is somehow perfectly fine while forcing people who can afford to buy insurance to take responsibility for themselves is tyranny. Of course, doctors just raise prices on everyone else. If you don’t see you are paying for something, though, people think it is free.

3) Keeping children on parent plans until 26 - This is at once completely irrelevant and wildly popular. The reason people love it is that it forces large employers to pay a portion of their older children’s premium. Since they don’t see those costs, they think they are getting something free. In truth, health insurers love this, because 19-26 year olds are the people they love to insure. The Donald has already promised to keep this.

4) No benefit limits - This goes back to guaranteed issue. It is incredibly complicated. It is possible that lifetime (or more likely annual) limits will come back. I believe this would be a disaster. It would allow health insurers to go back to their old ways of just telling the sickest people to go die, because they used up all the insurance they bought. We end up with the same problem of doctors having to treat people who cannot pay for it. The worst case scenario is that we will go back to millions of people being “insured” by “mini-meds.” A mini-med is an “insurance” policy with a limit as low as $5,000. To call a mini-med insurance is like calling an umbrella a house. But plenty of people (literally millions) paid for these frauds that are completely worthless. I guess if you are delighted by the idea of “a fool and his money are soon parted,” you might love the idea of having mini-meds back. If you love your insurance, you can keep your insurance actually translates to: If you love buying into a scam, you can continue to pay for a scam. Allowing insurers to set genuine limits would certainly reduce the cost of plans.

5) State exchanges - Most people didn’t understand the concept of “exchange” as it was being used here. Most states did not set up an exchange. The exchanges started using the word marketplace instead. This the most visible and concrete part of Obamacare. It is where you go to buy “Obamacare” plans. This is very similar to how you go to Travelocity to buy airplane tickets. If shutting down a website really floats your boat, well have fun. Nobody in their right mind thinks shutting down a website where you buy insurance will somehow improve the availability of insurance. Does anyone seriously believe shutting down Travelocity will make your airline tickets cheaper?

What this leaves out is the actually important parts of Obamacare which nobody talks about. Medical Loss Ratio (MLR), Essential Health Benefits (EHB), Out of Pocket Maximums (OoPM) and the Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC). Anyone who talks about repealing or replacing Obamacare without knowing exactly what these terms mean is an ignoramus who should just shut up. I have yet to see a single politician or politician’s policy proposal that includes these terms. If you want to know if someone is talking out of their ass, ask them if they know those abbreviations. Not knowing what MLR, EHB, OoPM and APTC stand for is proof positive you have no idea what you are saying.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Nov 11, 2016, 7:14 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Les Deplorables</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I can’t believe I need to address this at length, but apparently this election has caused even reasonable people to lose their minds.

I had someone I consider a friend actually make the incredible statement that anyone voting for Donald Trump obviously doesn’t view racism, sexism, etc. as something important. “Well you&#039;d only vote for him if those aren&#039;t hard deal-breakers for you.” Only a desire to salvage the friendship is making me spell out why this statement is vulgar, idiotic and obscene.

Let us start with obscene. Hillary Clinton has been profusely apologizing for saying “half” of Trump’s supporters fall into this basket of horrible people. If that doesn’t convince you that this isn’t something unacceptable in polite society, then imagine if she had said ALL of Donald Trump’s supporters were racists, sexists, etc. Insulting millions of Americans is unacceptable period. Even if it were TRUE (and it isn’t), you don’t say such things. Just like you don’t go around saying to every woman you see “you have a vagina” or everyone you see “I just took a shit.” This is usually something we have to teach little children. But since this election has broken every other convention of morality, I guess this is the least of my complaints.

As with most obscenities, this statement is a vulgar generalization. Do you know who makes vulgar generalizations about large swaths of human beings? Bigots. And this is about as bigoted a statement as you can make. Someone disagrees with you, you attribute that disagreement to what could possibly be true of some of the people who disagree with you and then you paint every single other person that you intolerantly dismiss as having the worst characteristics of those people. It shouldn’t really require much thought to see why something like a single characteristic (your vote for President) that is as limited (a sum total of 6 options on the outside) that depends on so many factors is a bad criterion for assigning horrible characteristics (racist, sexist, etc.) to individuals. But apparently, it does!

So allow me to explain why this statement is idiotic.

If you do vote (and we generally accept that you should), the general consensus (which I disagree with) is that you only have two options. You can vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. ANYONE who thinks that voting for one of these people can only be a result of finding that person anything less than objectionable is an idiot. I am not exaggerating here, but let me prove it to you beyond any reasonable doubt.

First, let us realize that there are millions of people who are single issue voters. Take abortion for example. Millions of people in the United States have for both emotional and intellectual reasons decided that they will uniformly vote based on that issue alone. They may have had a life affecting experience or it may be part of their religion. Many religious Catholics will only vote for a candidate who opposes abortion and many self-respecting feminists will only vote for a candidate who supports abortion rights. There are many important issues on the line here, including the Second Amendment. Despite the liberal trope that President Obama failed to take all our guns away, we all know that it was not for a lack of trying. After every mass shooting, President Obama held a press conference calling for gun control. Does being a single-issue voter really mean that you must find racism and sexism unobjectionable?

Second, let us realize that there are millions of people who are “low information” voters. Before you take too much time looking down your nose at “low information” voters, take some time to realize that economists generally agree following politics is a waste of time for most people. Then take the time to think of the people who work 2 jobs as single parents or any of the other million real life reasons why someone might not have time to spend as much time to pay attention to politics. If you honestly think every Trump voter has spent the time to investigate the allegations of racism, sexism, etc.; you don’t know many poor people. Are you still sure that YOU aren’t the bigot in the room, because all signs are pointing to the fact that you just might be. You might think that Donald Trump is different and everyone should aware of these accusations unless they were hiding under a rock. But Republicans are always being unfairly accused of racism, sexism, etc.

Third, you are obviously dismissing every single reason to hate Hillary Clinton. Including being a fan of Bernie Sanders! Yes, Bernie Sanders sold his soul to Hillary Clinton. That doesn’t mean that plenty of Bernie Sanders fans don’t view Hillary Clinton as worse than Trump. Plenty of Trump voters are most concerned about our foreign military involvements. Is it really hard to imagine someone without a sexist, racist, Islamophobic bone in her body voting against the Secretary of State who orchestrated our intervention in Libya?

Fourth, people have reasons to vote a certain way that are perfectly legitimate and outside the scope of your own considerations. The extreme example would be personal friends of Juanita Broadrick. Do you think any of them are voting for Hillary Clinton? How about the hundreds of thousands of members of the Fraternal Order of Police and their families? You may be aware that the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Hillary Clinton. Were you aware that she snubbed them by refusing to even seek their endorsement? Can you honestly expect any member to vote for her when she explicitly declined their vote?

Now, let us return to the original statement. “Well you&#039;d only vote for him if [racism, sexism, etc.] aren&#039;t hard deal-breakers for you.”

Heard anything more bigoted, obscene, vulgar or idiotic recently?</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Oct 23, 2016, 9:38 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Of Nuts and Sluts</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div> 

Understanding the following should not in any way depend on party affiliation or political beliefs. This is about being a moral human being.

Employing the &quot;nuts and sluts&quot; defense against accusations of sexual assault is proof in itself of being a horrible person. If someone is truly emotionally unstable (a &quot;nut&quot;) then that person can&#039;t consent anyway. A decent human being doesn&#039;t have sex with emotionally unstable people. Sexual relations with someone who has significant emotional problems is an indecent assault by the emotionally sound person.

If the person enjoys an active sex life (a &quot;slut&quot;), then it logically follows that THIS PARTICULAR ENCOUNTER is out of the ordinary. We are talking about someone who supposedly enjoys sex and seeks it out. If this person is wont to seek out sex, why was this encounter different than the others? Public accusations of assault are unlikely to improve your sex life. (Notice that the &quot;slut&quot; defense is completely different than arguing the person has made similar accusations against other people.)

These &quot;defenses&quot; are not defenses at all. If the sexual encounter occurred at all, the accusation that it was an assault being put forth by a &quot;nut&quot; or a &quot;slut&quot; is actually MORE credible than one by the theoretical perfectly sane and chaste victim. The most ridiculous aspect is that much of society defines being sane and chaste as mutually exclusive.

What is worse is that &quot;defending&quot; against accusations of sexual assault by smearing the alleged victim is itself a case of abuse. Contrary to popular belief, the nuts and sluts defense can be even more of an emotional victimization than the actual assault. When you are assaulted, only that one person is assaulting you for a set period of time and you tend to believe that the rest of society will vindicate your rights. You can attempt to start a healing process. You can feel safe with others. After all, the vast majority of human beings are revolted by the idea of sexual assault.

When you are accused of DESERVING the assault because you may have emotional problems (who can&#039;t be painted as such?) or you were asking for it (who can&#039;t be painted as such?); it emotionally devastates the victim because it pulls out the rug from under that person. You annihilate the possibility of being safe. You start driving home the idea that the victim DESERVES to be assaulted, meaning that it may happen again. The underlying assertion is that the emotionally vulnerable or people who express interest in someone else SHOULD be assaulted. You instill anxiety and fear about what may happen NOW because the victim is now publicly known as a nut/slut. It rips the wound open and keeps it open with the assertion that what happened was morally justifiable.

For the love of all that is good, don&#039;t fall into the trap of giving credence to smearing victims of sexual assault. The only good defenses against an accusation of sexual assault are that it never happened or that the accused would not act that way. Discussion of the victim is largely irrelevant. The fact is that the crime of sexual assault is like any other crime in terms of the act and intent. It does not revolve around the question of what the victim did or believed. It revolves around the question of what the accused did or believed. That focus should not be shifted to the victim. You defend someone who is accused of murder with assertions that s/he did not commit murder or would not commit murder. Would you argue that a murderer should go free because the victim was emotionally unstable or already deathly ill?</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Oct 14, 2016, 2:42 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">What is your soul made of?</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>This isn’t a question of the supernatural. It is a question often asked in Talmudic logic when dealing with a specious argument. The phrase “what is your soul made of?” is used to confront someone is making contradictory claims. It is often translated “which is it?”

The Donald’s latest statements regarding the Hillary keep making me think, “what is his soul made of? Which way does he want it?”

For example, let’s take his statement that Hillary Clinton started the rumors that President Obama was born in Kenya. (I actually believe this has more basis in fact than most of the Donald’s claims.) Were Clinton supporters right or wrong to fan those flames? Is Hillary Clinton responsible for these statements coming from her camp? Were the people who genuinely doubted the President’s birth certificate dupes? Was Clinton doing a public service, like Trump claims he was, by encouraging these doubts?

Or let’s look at the claims regarding Hillary Clinton’s health. If Hillary really is moments away from death, should we really be so concerned about the havoc she will wreak as President? Was she spending her time recuperating from some cocktail of horrible diseases, or selling the State Department to the highest bidder? You can’t have your cake and eat it too.

What is Donald Trump’s soul made of? What about the soul of his avid supporters? What do they really believe?

When you cut through the rhetoric, it seems absolutely nothing. There is nothing Donald Trump will not say, if he believes it to be to his advantage. Which makes him completely indistinguishable to me from Hillary Clinton.

If you are concerned with such things as logic, facts and souls; I suggest you tune out of the coming debates. If I do end up watching them, it will be for the same reason I watch action movies. There might be some entertaining pyrotechnics. I just hope the fire doesn’t spread.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Sep 18, 2016, 3:05 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Beirut and Paris</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>What do you think of when you hear the word Beirut? What cities around the world would you compare it to? What do you imagine its streets to be like?

I doubt many Americans are aware of what Beirut used to be. Beirut was once known far and wide as the “Paris of the Middle East.” I have heard it many times from Baby Boomers, but especially when I speak with Lebanese people.  My parents remember it being called that. I can see their eyes lose focus as they travel back in time to see what some hope may come again. Many speak with a certain bitterness and mourning. Some with anger. And some with a consuming hatred.

An elderly client of mine sat across my desk. He was Christian Lebanese. I spoke about being Jewish Iranian. I spoke about my time in Israel, my family in Israel, a Lebanese friend I met in Israel. He told me, as so many people have before, that Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East. His Beirut. The Beirut he had grown up in. The Beirut he had fled from.

He leaned closer and said, “Sharon had the right idea in Sabra and Shatila.”

I admit I was a bit flummoxed and uncertain what to say. What do you say to an elderly client who, even guardedly, suggests genocide? We can debate Ariel Sharon’s role in the Massacre of Sabra and Shatila. We can discuss whether it was just a bloodbath or full on genocide. The numbers and exact status of the dead are a source of considerable doubt. We can debate what Sharon’s responsibility was to interfere, whether those slaughtered were combatants, who knew what and when. It is not at all clear what exactly he could have done and how.

Since the Holocaust, Jews have been particularly damning of people who look the other way while other people slaughter each other. Even that accusation was enough to seriously harm Sharon’s political standing in Israel. My client had no such doubts about what Sharon knew, what the phalanges did or who was killed. He believed the worst of the allegations about the “Butcher of Sabra and Shatila.” And he approved!

I’ve sat through many discussions with clients that have gone awry into territory best not explored. I generally just try to change the subject back to the business at hand and let it be. I often hear all sorts of political diatribes about Obamacare. My now well practiced line is: “The next time President Obama calls to ask my opinion, I’ll be sure to mention you said that.” 

I didn’t have a prepared line for this. 

Archie Bunker was sitting across my desk. I love Archie Bunker. I especially love Archie Bunker for the civility he teaches even today. Archie isn’t an evil man. He isn’t a cruel man. He isn’t even a bad man. He is an intellectually lazy man. He is a self-absorbed man. He is a stupid man. 

I think all of us have a bit of Archie in us. I think showing a little kindness to Archie does a lot more good than harm. I think keeping the Archies in the world in mind teaches us patience and tolerance. That doesn’t change the fact that self-absorption, stupidity and laziness are bad. But it does help to reduce the amount of unproductive fighting, hurled insults and knee-jerk intransigence. I don’t think Archie’s son-in-law insulting Archie ever did any good, and we as the audience understood that.

Beirut is ashes. It is a war-torn ruin. It is dominated by puppet actors fighting over rubble. In other words, it is like much of the rest of the Middle East, Africa, South Asia and Latin America. To those who knew it as a City of Light, it has become a City of Flames. This is a source of incredible pain. To those who had to flee, it causes a visceral need to identify a source and lash out. 

I understand that. I came to the United States as a political assylee from religious persecution. Islamists took over Iran and started persecuting religious minorities. It is estimated that some two to three thousand Persian Jews, about a tenth of the whole population, were jailed on accusations of being Zionists around 1982. One of my acquaintances was 14 years old when he went to jail on charges of espionage. The treatment of the Baha’i population, generally believed to be heretics in Islam, was far more egregious. It is no mean feat to be more despised as a people than Jews in a Muslim country.

When we left Iran, we did not go to Israel. This was not a difficult decision for my father. He went to college in Israel. We have family in Israel. He had tried to make a living in Israel before he was married. Israel was familiar territory. But my father did not want to jump from the frying pan into the fire. Israel has been beset since its creation with Islamists. My father did not relish the idea of his daughter or son being drafted into that fight. He was fleeing Islam and decided to keep on running as far as he could.

The morning of 9-11, I had a flat tire. I went to Pep Boys near USC to buy new ones. At the time, I was more religiously observant and wore a yarmulke. An elderly black woman struck up a conversation. I remember telling her how I had fled Islamists as a child. I remember telling her how Islamists had driven my family from Israel, which is why I was in America. I asked her, “where do I run to now?” 

That question still haunts me. It haunted me when ISIS loyalists slaughtered my neighbors in San Bernardino. It haunts me when I see attacks all over places that were once considered safe. It haunts me when I see Paris has become the Beirut of Europe. Make no mistake about it. Islamists kill obscenely larger numbers of Muslims than anyone else. I expect to see mass graves of Shiites all over ISIS territory. I fear the numbers will be in the 6 or even 7 digits. Just this past Ramadan, ISIS proudly claimed to have murdered over 5k human beings. The victims were almost exclusively Muslims living in Muslim countries.

Which brings me to yet another reincarnation of Archie Bunker. The Donald. As I said before, I love Archie. I love him because he is human. I love him because he teaches us civility. I love him because he convinced me that I need to treat people with empathy. I love him because he convinced me that being wrong is not the same as being evil. I tolerate Archie Bunker. I tolerate all the lazy, stupid and scared people. I too am lazy, stupid and scared in varying degrees. I love Archie Bunker because I love human beings and I love humanity. We are a most wondrous and divine Creation.

I can understand the attraction of the Donald. When you get home from work, sit in your comfy chair, pop open a beer and turn on the boob tube; you don’t want to listen to news about one Islamist or another murdering people. You want the simple pleasures of being lazy and stupid. You want simple answers. You don’t want to think things through. You don’t want a call to action based on some complex morality. You want simple. You want meat and potatoes, not quiche.

I like meat and potatoes. I like a beer in a comfy chair in front of a boob tube.  I fear Islamists. That doesn’t make me an Islamophobe. A phobia is an irrational fear that disrupts your ability to function. But, for the love of everything that isn’t lazy and stupid, I don’t want Archie Bunker to be President of the United States! I don’t want my President’s policies to be focused on fear and hatred, no matter how justified it may be.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Aug 15, 2016, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Sexual Assault As It Used to Exist</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>We have come a long way from the days of the Clinton impeachment. I can tell that because so many young people would flip their lids if they knew what Hillary Clinton would prefer remain ancient history. So, gather round children. Uncle Jacob is going to tell you a story about the bad old days. 

The days when it was considered perfectly acceptable to call a woman who was assaulted by her boss a “bimbo.” The days when it was considered okay to trade sexual favors for workplace favors. The days where “powerful” men were expected to “have masculine appetites.” The days when “lying about sex” was considered perfectly legitimate behavior, even under oath. 

Back in 1994, probably before many of you were born, a woman came forward to accuse the President of the United States of having sexually assaulted her. Nowadays, it is perfectly acceptable to not name this woman. After all, we realize that it doesn’t matter who SHE is. It matters whether or not her attacker did it. But in those days, it mattered very much who she was. She was variously referred to as “trailer park trash,” had her looks made fun of and generally assaulted with all kinds of accusations we would find offensive. But let us skip all of that and focus on where those accusations led.

Her accusation led her to file a court case. During that court case, as was her right, she brought forth evidence. And she demanded evidence from the President of the United States. It took a Supreme Court decision, but she ultimately prevailed. The President of the United States is not above the law. The President of the United States must answer in court. The President of the United States was forced to testify. And he perjured himself. He perjured himself before the court and he perjured himself before the American people. Thus were born the famous words, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.”

None of these facts are in any way contested. These are truths that everyone agrees to and acknowledges.

Since those days in the mid to late 1990s, much has changed. Today, we realize that sexual predators can easily be identified by the trail of victims they leave. Think of Bill Cosby. One accuser? Might be a case of “he said, she said.” Two accusers? Less likely. Many accusers? Well, we no longer give that predator much leeway. Let there be no doubt about it. Bill Clinton has left a very long trail of accusers behind him. Of every political stripe. Of various ages. Of various backgrounds. Woman after woman has come forward to publicly admit she has been a victim of his inappropriate advances.

Each of these women has been subjected to a barrage of abuse that our society no longer tolerates. Except from one person: Hillary Rodham Clinton.

“Well, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.”

I, of course, agree with this statement. If there is evidence, then we should follow it. And there is mountains of evidence. All of it pointing at the fact that William Jefferson Clinton is a serial, sexual abuser of women. He is a known liar and his record of being a slave to his sexual depravity is well documented. As recently as 2003, Bill Clinton took  26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express.”

Let us be perfectly clear what it would mean to the rights of women to equal treatment if Bill Clinton returns to the White House. Hillary Rodham Clinton has been an active participant in defending her husband’s inexcusable behavior. We know of a number of women who have come forward. Hillary Clinton called three of them liars BY NAME as recently as September. The evidence points to the opposite of her conclusion. Her husband deserves to be disbelieved based on the evidence, not his accusers. She knows that.

Hillary Clinton may become the first female President of the United States. But I can hardly see that as a victory for feminism as long as the many victims of her husband are treated like “bimbos.” The day she takes office is the day that every woman her husband assaulted gets victimized once again.

As someone who views sexual assault as a serious problem, I cannot view that as in any way superior to a President Trump.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Jul 25, 2016, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Donaldcare</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>In case you were interested in a detailed analysis of Donaldcare:

 The Donald gets his facts wrong. (Surprise!) Obamacare has most definitely increased competition, which is why it has led to a precipitous cut in pay for doctors. Of course, the idea of repealing Obamacare wholesale is completely absurd. The only person with an actual proposal to do something that absurd has been Sanders. (Surprise!) I am assuming the Donald’s actual proposal is to change Obamacare.

1) Eliminating the individual mandate is wrongheaded, but not going to affect much. The real driving force behind Obamacare is the Advanced Premium Tax Credit, which subsidizes the purchase of insurance. I would like to see the individual mandate have real bite to it, but that is unlikely to happen any time soon. It has virtually no bite now, since anyone who earns enough to pay a significant penalty amount already has health insurance. Consider the fact that the maximum penalty is 2.5% of your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (line 37 of 1040 forms) and the cheapest policy for even the youngest person is going to cost around $4k. You would have to earn $160,000 a year as a 20 year old to make buying insurance the same price as paying the penalty.

2) Allowing sale of insurance across state lines is a great idea that is in Obamacare already, but don&#039;t bother Trump with facts. Expanding that should have been done long ago. Everyone  who understands the idea other than the State of New York and various special interests, loves it. The barriers to trade between the states should never have been allowed in the first place. New York actually bars any health insurance company not headquartered in New York from selling insurance in New York. Collect taxes on that much?

3) A tax deduction for health insurance premiums is welfare for the rich. 

4) HSAs already exist. His minor change would make them immune to estate taxes. More welfare for the rich. 

5) Price transparency would be great. Obamacare has done wonders in that regard. I suspect medical providers would scream bloody murder, but Obamacare has already put the screws on them.

6) Medicaid is already administered by states individually. A MUCH better idea would be expanding the APTC and Cost Share Reduced plans to replace Medicaid. I assume the only reason I can&#039;t find numbers on the cost of 100% APTC for a 100% CSR plan versus Medicaid is that it makes too much sense. It would privatize Medicaid, which is the opposite of single-payer. Republicans hate it because it buys into Obamacare. Democrats hate it because it would be a market reform like Obamacare. He hints at doing that in #3 for some reason.

7) Importing more drugs is a perennial proposal. It will save money and it will reduce the safety of drugs. China will be manufacturing our drugs. If I trusted the safety of products made in China more, I would be all for this globalist free trade proposal from Mr. Anti-Globalism.

He doesn’t mention guaranteed issue, out of pocket maximums and essential health benefits. I think you can safely assume he would not want Congress repealing Obamacare on those matters. They are the actual nuts and bolts of the Affordable Care Act.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Jul 7, 2016, 6:23 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Fear and Loathing in the 21st Century</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Love is nice. Kindness is nice. Happiness is nice. These are positive emotions. Then there are negative emotions like sadness, fear, anger and hate. To quote Yoda, “Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.” Well, we all want to be Jedi, not Sith, right?

We have a lot of cultural claptrap about negative emotions. We even support such patently horrible ideas as “negative emotions cause cancer.” We blame people for having negative emotions, we shame them and we tell them to stop having those emotions as if there is a switch they can flip. Human psychology is more complex than that. Human physiology is more complex than that. Causation is way too hard to prove and spurious correlations are way too common for any of these things to be remotely useful.

I don’t think anyone doesn’t recognize that there is a lot of fear, anger, sadness and hate around us. The unfortunate thing is that people seem to think these emotions only exist in the “other.” Some liberals are so sure that Trump supporters are horrible homophobic, racists that they broke a gay, Hispanic man’s nose for going to a Trump rally. One lunatic was so against a “hate group” opposed to gay marriage that he shot someone who worked there. 

If you don’t recognize that the support of the Second Amendment is based on fear, you just have not thought about it enough. People who support the Second Amendment may like to go to go hunting and may like target shooting as a sport. We don’t have separate entries in the Bill of Rights to protect people’s hobbies, especially when those hobbies involve very dangerous things like guns. As a supporter of the Second Amendment, I am perfectly aware that guns are made with the purpose of killing people. That is why I believe I need access to guns. My support of the Second Amendment is deeply rooted in being a political asylee and a member of a historically persecuted religious minority.

We are human beings, not cartoon characters. We have a mix of emotions. Those emotions include fear, anger, hatred, sadness, etc. and that is sometimes a good thing. Negative emotions can spur us to good actions as well as to negative action. But that isn’t even the point. Even if fear were completely worthless, we cannot tell other people how to feel! A person cannot even tell himself how to feel! We cannot discard people because they have feelings we don’t agree with. 

I have seen way too many “Eureka!” moments when someone recognizes (or simply claims) that the source of an opponent’s position is a negative emotion. Suddenly, that person claims a “superior” morality and acts as if he has suddenly “won.” Understanding why someone feels a certain way or believes a certain thing does not make you superior to that person. It most certainly does not mean you are right and that person is wrong.

Harriet Tubman, one of our national heroes, spent most of her life trafficking in anger, fear and even hatred. She was a supporter of John Brown’s Raid on Harper’s Ferry.  Is it wrong for an escaped slave to fear slavery? Is it wrong for her to hate slavery? Is it wrong for her to be angry at slavers? I don’t think so.

We are living in strange and interesting times. One of the strangest parts is that we are seeing a wave of political activism rooted in a rejection of “political correctness,” “intellectual elites,” “globalism” and the “establishment.” I believe that what underlies all of those is a rebellion by people who feel that their concerns have been sidelined. The people voting for Sanders, Trump, Brexit, etc. have very clearly rejected the idea that negative emotions are illegitimate. They are openly embracing the fact that they fear, are angry and even hate things like climate change, economic ruin, political tyranny, terrorism, etc.

I think it would help all of us if we stopped looking down at people because they are motivated by “negative” emotions. We should empathize with others and help them. Even negative emotions, when harnessed correctly, can have positive results. What never works is dismissing, belittling and shaming people for their emotions; negative or otherwise.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Jun 26, 2016, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Never, Ever Trump</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I have been a Republican as long as I have been politically aware. I registered as a Republican as soon as I turned 18. I do believe in party politics. Working together as a political coalition helps to succeed in advancing political interests. Political objectives cannot be achieved without political consensus.

I am also, and have strongly been, a formalist. I believe in the political process. For the past 8 years, I have made a point of challenging those people who would make the ridiculous statement that President Obama was not their President. He is the President of the United States, duly elected. If you are an American, then he is your President. Denying that says more about your commitment to the United States than anything about President Obama’s legitimacy. The exact same thing goes for George W. Bush.

As the absurdist tragedy of this latest political season has progressed, I have attempted to wrap my head around the fact that the next President of the United States is likely to be someone completely unacceptable. I am not saying someone I disagree with, I am saying someone completely unacceptable. We are down to two major candidates and a 70 year old baby.

I won’t spend much time dismissing Bernie Sanders, because he has less of a chance to be the next President than Ross Perot. (I just checked, Perot is still alive.) Let’s even dismiss my objections to the disastrous policies the Left wants to inflict on the United States.

Let’s just take Hillary Clinton as a candidate for a position that allows her to pardon and put to death human beings at her personal will. 

How anyone, especially a woman, with a shred of self-regard supports her is beyond me. The Donald has a long history of insulting women. Bill Clinton has a long history of assaulting women. I would like to think that we have gotten past the times when a powerful man could get away with dismissing women who repeatedly and credibly accuse him of assault by blaming the victim and “bimbo eruptions.” Unfortunately, it seems we are most definitely not past the time when Camille Cosby, Dottie Sandusky and Hillary Clinton can be excused for vilifying victims because being married to a rapist is somehow an excuse to join in the repeat victimization.

But let’s say that you have somehow convinced yourself that Bill Clinton’s sexual escapades are all smoke and no fire. You have convinced yourself that it is somehow acceptable for a man to perjure himself while answering in a court of law about sexually harassing his employees. That because he was politically connected, he should go free when his accuser would most certainly have ended up in jail for perjuring herself so clearly and unashamedly. That all of this doesn’t reflect on Hillary Clinton’s view towards sex and power.

Hillary Clinton promises to be the most corrupt President since Richard Nixon. Forget about the classified material on her private email server. The reason we found out about her private email server is that we have a Freedom of Information Act in this country. She deliberately evaded recordkeeping laws. That alone should disqualify her from serious contention. 

She has repeatedly been caught lying to the American people for her personal gain. We have gotten so used to politicians lying to us that we no longer have any red lines. I am still outraged that Sandy Burglar never served any jail time. Hillary’s actions regarding her emails is Sandy’s criminal activity writ large. Does anyone in this country honestly believe that Hillary Clinton is “fundamentally honest?” I have a bridge for sale!

So, I have many reasons for wanting to accept that bitter pill which is Donald Trump. There are no viable alternatives. He pays lip service to the Second Amendment, which is a red flag issue for me. He might actually secure the border. He is obviously the choice of a large number of Americans, which always gives me pause before I dismiss someone. There is the “hope” that he is lying about everything he says in his campaign.

Donald Trump is crass. He says offensive things. He has many personal faults, not to exclude being a professional confidence man. He will do and say anything to expand his personal fame and fortune. Donald Trump has taken the Clinton disregard for honesty and the law to an even more untenable degree. Sadly enough, that doesn’t make him unique in politics.

But I am a republican, not a democrat. (That is very deliberately written with a lowercase R and a lowercase D.) While I prefer the majority’s thoughts to be heard, I do not believe that the will of the majority trumps the rights of the minority. I do have red lines. I believe that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That these rights extend to all people at all times.

Donald Trump has publicly espoused crimes against humanity by advocating the murder of the family members of terrorists. He lays claim to political power by threatening violence. He is completely devoid of even the most passing knowledge of basic ethics. He has expressed contempt for fundamental freedoms, international law and our Constitution.

This does make him unique.

If Hillary Clinton wins, she will most regrettably still be my President.  As an American, as a Jew and as a human being; I will never, ever accept Trump as my leader. 

 Even under pain of death, I will never accept violations of the basic rights of man.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">May 5, 2016, 6:35 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">The Mythical Human Rights Islamist</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>You may be aware of the Harvard Law School’s most recent controversy, regarding Husam el-Qoulaq. To make a long story short, there was an event at Harvard involving two very prominent negotiators of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. During the question and answer period, Husam used his very well honed skills as a budding attorney to ask the former Foreign Minister of Israel and prominent Member of Knesset why she is “so smelly.”

There was, of course, an outcry regarding the patently inappropriate, ad hominem allusion to well-known antisemitic stereotypes. Husam has issued an (at the time anonymous) apology that actually only digs the hole deeper. His claim is that he did not know about the stereotype and his comment was misunderstood. He doesn’t explain what his comment meant, but apologizes that people may have been hurt by an understandable misunderstanding of his non-understandable question.

Even if you take him at his word, it only proves that he is an ignoramus whose presence at the event was a waste of both space and time. If you are going to be an activist and student leader regarding Palestinian-Israeli issues, a cursory knowledge of antisemitism is definitely a prerequisite. Bernie Sanders’s ignorant remarks at the New York debate about Israel did highlight a valid point: If you are only concerned about one side of the conflict, then you are obviously missing the bigger picture. He was right that people who wish for the resolution of the conflict need to consider the needs of Gazans, West Bank residents and Arab gentiles into the equation as well as Arab Jews and Israelis.*

If there is one problem we have as a society, it is the fetishizing of not knowing. The dropping of all context and the glorification of soundbites. The iDiocy of the niTwitters. I have come to the realization that idiocy is in fact infinite. No matter how hard you work to idiot-proof something, someone will invent a better idiot. 

Unfortunately, just as there are larger or smaller infinities, there are larger and smaller classes of idiocy. There is the smaller idiocy of this particular student, who identifies as Palestinian and claims he wants “justice for his people.” There is the larger idiocy of people who don’t identify as Palestinians, yet identify with clearly spurious movements that claim justice for Palestinians.

The smaller idiocy can be understood because myopic visions of your own problems are inherent to the human condition. Scapegoating, like Sanders does of the rich or Trump does of foreigners, is commonplace idiocy. Simplistic solutions for your own problems have an emotional draw and they are easy to adopt. The greater idiocy of looking from an objective vantage point and being able to hone in on spurious lies to support takes a higher caliber of idiot to manage.

Several Jewish Harvard Law School students signed a letter in support of their friend Husam. They are convinced that the “vicious smear campaign” is a “part of a sadly well-worn playbook aimed at discrediting and defaming those who dare challenge Israel’s abuses...” They conclude that “We know that Husam’s acts of protest are ultimately motivated by an impulse to expose and confront injustice, which he does with a bravery that we envy.”

All of this assumes that those who attack Israel are somehow concerned about the welfare of Palestinians. That is patently false. Husam el-Qoulaq is at best a fool. My respect for Harvard Law School makes me think I am giving him too much credit by divorcing him from what are most likely malignant intentions.

If you give the slightest damn about Muslims, you must realize that the greatest threat to the world’s Muslim population is Islamism. Some of the people slaughtered by various Islamists like the governments of Iran, the Islamic State**, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, etc. are Jews, Christians, Hindus or other minorities. The vast majority are Muslims. These governments, the bloody borders they maintain and the insurgents they support around the world have inflicted deaths in the millions on Muslims. They terrorize Muslims by the billions. That terror is far more pervasive and tangible than anything they inflict on us.

Imagine for one minute what life would be like in the West Bank town of Ramallah if Israel were to pull out just as it did in Gaza. Would girls be more or less likely to have their lives completely obliterated by sexism? We aren’t talking about unequal wages. We are talking about starvation and lifelong abuse, if not outright murder.

Would homosexuals be more or less likely to be murdered by their own government? We aren’t talking about a government that doesn’t protect the rights of homosexuals. We are talking about a government that will prosecute allegations of homosexuality as a capital crime.

Would religious freedom be better protected? Forget about the ability to change your religion, which is a capital crime in Islamist ideology. Muslims are being murdered by the thousand simply for following the various different traditions within Islam that have developed over the years.

Look at the refugee situation in Syria. We are talking about millions of people fleeing for their lives. What would destabilizing Syria’s borders further by removing the Israeli presence do?

What kind of human rights advocate looks at the situation of Palestinians and says that the main source of their problem is Israel instead of Islamists? That a power vacuum in the occupied territories is going to improve life for Palestinians? That the standard of living will go up when Hamas uses tax dollars for suicidal jihad instead of feeding its own population?

You can be 100% sure that Husam el-Qoulaq knows very well what civil rights are. He is about to graduate from Harvard Law School and worked at the ACLU. You can be equally sure that Husam knows that even the slightest shred of lip service to those rights for people living in Israeli occupied territories is from Israel. 

Of course, this doesn’t mean that Israel’s policies are beyond criticism. They aren’t. They are criticized quite routinely, including by Israel. Treating people better than Saudi Arabia and Syria is hardly a compliment.

It does mean that any human rights activist worthy of the name would prefer maintaining Israeli control over the occupied territories over the devastating effects of Israel’s disappearance on Muslims. No one who cares about Palestinians would hand them over to Islamists any more than a firefighter would throw people out of a 10th story window to “save” them from a fire.

If you think that I am creating a false dichotomy, then you are right. I am. It is not simply a question of whether Israel will rule over Ramallah or Islamists will rule over Ramallah.

Your assumption is that by “occupied territories” and “Palestinians,” I am referring only to Muslim Arabs and territory Israel acknowledges as being occupied. But that isn’t the conversation at all. The people criticizing Israel do not want Israel ruling over Tel Aviv either. They don’t want Israel to withdraw. They want Israel to disappear. 

If you doubt me, simply ask them. Ask them basic questions about the welfare of Jews, about antisemitism, about the Israeli government they want to see in the future. What about Jewish access to Jewish holy sites? What about border controls and trade considerations? Where and how do the non-Muslims exist in their perfect world where Israel no longer abuses Palestinians?

These considerations will take them by surprise, just like  Ser Davos asking Ser Alistair Thorne about mutton. They make no provisions for the existence of Israel, any more than they make provisions for the Muslim apostate or homosexual. How else could Husam be so patently ignorant of basic Jewish history and so devoid of empathy towards Jews as to act the way he did?

*If you want a clear indication of how ignorant someone is about Israel, ask them what percentage of Israeli Jews are descended from people who have lived in Muslim countries since the Middle Ages. It is over 50%, meaning sending the Jews &quot;back to Europe&quot; is about as non-sensical as sending the Palestinians &quot;back&quot; to Africa. Much of my family in Israel still speaks neo-Aramaic as a first language. As does much of my family here in the United States. We are descended from people who never left Babylon after the captivity in the 6th century BCE.

**Any pretence that the Islamic State is a terrorist organization as opposed to a sovereign nation-state is mere pretence. The international community likes to delegitimize nation-states by refusing them recognition. That is understandable. When faced with a threat, however, you cannot make the mistake of believing your own propaganda.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 26, 2016, 7:03 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Disqualifying Wizards of the Coast</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Here are some choice quotes from Wizards of the Coast’s arguments to the court. They are too absurd for both laughter and tears.

For example, Plaintiff baldly claims that individuals seeking to become judges must interview with a Level 2 or higher Judge.

Wizards of the Coast is trying to deny that individuals seeking to become judges must interview with a Level or higher Judge. This new policy comes as a great surprise to me. Is this newer than the rules on drafting DFCs?

 In this case, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts supporting his bald conclusions that he performed &quot;work...&quot;

Judging is not “work.” Is Wizards going to start charging us admission for the fun of conducting deck checks and passing out booster packs?

Plaintiff has not and cannot allege that he has judged a Magic tournament organized by Wizards or that he has ever worn a uniform of any kind, let alone a uniform Wizards required.

Do any of us NOT recognize Judge uniforms? What exactly do they mean by “let alone a uniform Wizards required?” Where did the Judge uniforms come from? Ninja cosplay?

Plaintiff relies on the “Find a Judge” link..., but conveniently ignores that it directs visitors to the Magic Judge Blog operated by a third party?

The Magic Judge Blog is operated by a third party? Who? SCG? CFB? The listing of judges isn’t a direct link to the information on judge.wizards.com ?!? I have certified many judges. I did all of them using Wizards’s website using their DCI numbers issued by Wizards.

“The Magic Judge Blog is an independent site run by Magic judges[;]” it is not a Wizards’ site.

 The Magic Judge Blog is not a Wizards site? Then whose is it? And who gave them permission to make [O]fficial announcements?

Again, as explained in Wizards’ moving papers and confirmed by the Plaintiff’s own attachments, the “Magic Judge Code” is contained on a third-party Wiki page... Plaintiff ignores this inconvenient fact, instead insisting that the Court should overlook the source of the document and accept as true his contradictory attribution of this document to Wizards.

Contradictory attribution of the Magic Judge Code to Wizards. WHAT?!? The Magic Judge Code isn’t Wizards’s? Then whose is it? It was anonymous vandalism on a wiki page? It isn’t part of the documents Wizards expects all judges to abide by? Then how did all those judges get suspended by Wizards?

Plaintiff does not allege to have been classified or treated by Wizards as an independent contractor...

Ummmm. Then the Plaintiff needs to look over the applications for events. I guess we are pretending Magicjudges.org is a third-party site that has nothing to do with Wizards. That is why there is a role called “WotC staff” on it for someone who mysteriously is the Judge Manager at Wizards of the Coast which has nothing to do with the Judge Program.

Nevertheless, Plaintiff attempts to draw an analogy using the Judge’s own certification program, which merely certifies that an individual has a certain level of knowledge with respect to the Magic game. [This is not different than an organization certifying an individual as competent to perform CPR. Certifying minimal competency does not equate to an employment relationship.]

This is just plain insulting! Being a certified judge shows a certain level of knowledge like CPR?!? I want to hear Helene Bergeot read these lines in front of a group of judges without lowering her head in shame. Then she can tell us about how much Wizards values the work of judges without sounding sarcastic.

Similarly, Plaintiff’s attempt to equate suspension or decertification of a judge to being “fired” in an employment context is functionally equivalent to arguing that Yelp’s ability to suspend or close a consumer’s account constitutes the right to fire.

Now being a certified judge is like having a Yelp account. If I get suspended from the DCI, it is like having my Yelp account suspended. Anybody else find the analogy more than a bit insulting?

Last, but not least, is Wizards dismissing the fact that it cannot use the “volunteer exception” because Wizards never used the volunteer exception! The lawyer’s language is too long and confused to quote. I am guessing that has something to do with the lawyer himself not being able to quite grasp how Wizards can deny that they have pretended we could be volunteers for years.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 21, 2016, 2:45 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Suing Wizards will not kill Magil</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I don’t know exactly where the “kill Magil” reference comes from, but I have heard an urban legend about someone being distressed that something would kill Magic.

The truth is that MTG is a lot stronger and resilient than people give it credit for. More importantly, Hasbro is making BANK off Magic. The most common reason why people have defended skirting labor laws regarding Judges is that they think the costs would cripple tournaments. This is not true.

First, Hasbro is no more in danger of going bankrupt by treating judges well than McDonald’s is in danger of going bankrupt over a raise in the minimum wage. Wizards of the Coast spends millions of dollars on Organized Play. Even if they were required to pay judges, they would continue to make bank. 

Second, your local game store is not in danger. The relationship between a judge and Wizards of the Coast is in no way like that of your local game store. Your local game store provides a venue for Wizards of the Coast tournaments. But they are tournaments that belong to Wizards of the Coast. Ask yourself what would happen if your local store decided they wanted to let you play Yugioh cards at FNM. What would happen to a judge who did that? What would happen if Wizards suddenly said you could play Yugioh cards at FNM?

Exactly!

If I do something my local game store doesn’t like, they can stop me from playing there. If I do something Wizards doesn’t like, they can prevent me from ever playing Magic in any store anywhere in the whole world. That is why Helene Bergeot is so obviously wrong when she says “with the exception of the Pro Tour, the World Magic Cup, and the Magic World Championship, Magic events are run by tournament organizers and local game stores who directly engage judges.”

Magic events are sanctioned by Wizards of the Coast. They are held where Wizards of the Coast says they can be held. They are held when Wizards of the Coast says they can be held. They are held how Wizards of the Coast says they can be held. They are run how Wizards of the Coast says they can be run. They are run by who Wizards of the Coast says can run them. They can include players Wizards of the Coast says can play in them. They are run in the formats that Wizards of the Coast says they are to be run. They have the results Wizards of the Coast says they can have. They give out prizes in the way Wizards of the Coast says they can give out.

Magic the Gathering events are run by Wizards of the Coast. Try to hold an FNM otherwise, and see how fast they sue you.

Third, all of this would go away if Wizards would simply do what it has pretended to be doing since before I ever joined what used to be called the DCI. It is perfectly legal for a non-profit recreational gaming association to benefit from volunteers. Most judges would prefer to be such volunteers. To quote the complaint in one of the lawsuits:

[Wizards has been] misrepresenting and/or knowingly allowing [judges] to work as employees for Wizards under the false belief that they are “volunteers,” that they work for a “non-profit,” that the Judging program is “separate” from Wizards, that they are “not employees” of Wizards...

If Wizards would actually make good on having a Judge Program that was truly a “third-party,” we wouldn’t have any of these problems. That would obviously mean a large amount of control they would lose over the Judge Program. But that is the point.

If Wizards wants the type of control they have been trying to exercise over judges, they need to pay us. If they want us to be volunteers, then they need to set up a non-profit organization that can legally receive donations of our time. What they most definitely cannot do, is ask us to donate to Hasbro’s stockholders.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 20, 2016, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Why rock the boat?</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>If you have not already, I suggest you read Sean Catanese’s article regarding recent events. Notice this part in particular:

 We [Judge Conduct Committee] don’t oversee them [Wizards] in any fashion. We abide by their decisions because they’re not decisions that we’re empowered to remake or question. There’s a fundamental dependency of the Judge Program on Wizards, and that’s not something I was (or am) capable of changing in that moment or any other.  Ultimately, Magic is Wizards’ game and Wizards’ property, simple as that.  

My differences with the Judge Program are much older than the mistreatment of Justin Turner and the other judges specifically involved with this particular incident. Judges in the Judge Program are mistreated. We are treated worse than employees can legally be treated. We have been for decades.

I could go into details. There are many other judges who could be named. I could go into what some would call ancient history. But that doesn’t matter and I don’t want to get bogged down in details.

The fact is that we as a Judge Community owe our fellow judges a degree of fairness. We owe judges the ability to speak their minds freely. We owe judges the right to complain about unfair treatment. We need people who can question these decisions by Wizards.

Magic is Wizards’s property. Judges are not Wizards’s property.

If you care about judges, you have to ask yourself, “who is supposed to protect judges from abuse?” When I first started, I thought that were the L4+ Judges. Many people did. Some still do. Talk to any Level 4 or Level 5 Judge and they will tell you it has never been the case. That is why I am glad that the Level 4 and Level 5 Judge positions have been abolished. 

I now know that there is nobody protecting judges from abuse. There is nobody who can question whether judges have been treated fairly. Even the Regional Coordinator Advisory Committee I spent literally thousands of hours in getting instituted failed miserably to protect one of its own members. Only the unique fortitude of James Bennett, a true hero in every sense of the word, was successful in achieving any results.

I believe that is why other judges have courageously decided to rock the boat. That is why I support them. Anyone who doesn’t support them should resign from the judge community. Community members do not abandon each other in their time of need. Community members band together to help each other.

Judges deserve to be treated fairly. As long as there is no process to make sure that happens, the waters will not be calm.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 20, 2016, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Minimum wage law</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Since Helene Bergeot’s article on the Mothership, people have had a lot of questions regarding what exactly the laws are, the point is and the possibilities. I am not a lawyer nor am I one of the courageous judges who have agreed to act as class representatives in the two lawsuits that have been filed. 

But I have been involved with this for quite a while, so I hope this will clarify things. This note is simply explaining what the minimum wage law is. Needless to say, Helene’s claims that the lawsuits are meritless has as much truthiness as WotC’s claims that judges don’t need to take a test to be certified.

The fact is that the United States has minimum wage laws. That means that you have to pay people who work for you. There are limited exceptions. For instance, people can donate their time to a non-profit. When I first joined the DCI, I thought it was a non-profit. That would have been legal. As you can see from the 9th cause of action in the complaint, that is actually a fraud. Several judges, including those behind both lawsuits, have asked for a mandatory injunction requiring Wizards to actually create such a non-profit.

Without one of the exceptions, a company is liable for treating people who work for it like employees. This applies in cases that would surprise most people. Say that you own a store. Someone walks into your store and starts cleaning the bathrooms. You don’t know this person. You never tell this person what to do. You just enjoy the fact that this person does so. While it may seem counterintuitive, you still owe this person minimum wage as if s/he is your employee!

Why? Because it is really easy for companies to get away with making up excuses for why someone is working for them for free. Often times, they will pretend people are doing things for free, but know very well that they are receiving some sort of benefit that is way under the minimum wage. This undermines the whole minimum wage system and it is precisely what Wizards of the Coast does with judges.

The law requires that if you receive the benefit of work, you must pay the legal minimum for it. This requirement is called “suffer to work.” Yes, you read that right. Suffer. If you so much as allow someone to do work that is to your benefit, you must pay for it. That is what minimum wage means. It is the minimum you must pay for work, regardless of anything else.

If you read Wizards’s absurd claims, you will see that they claim they do not even suffer Judges to do work for them. They even claim that judges do no “work.” If judges were only doing things that were fun, then the situation would be different. But we all know that in order to do the fun stuff of judging, Wizards requires us to do a lot of things that are not fun. More importantly, they treat us like employees.

You can’t tell someone who is showing up to a hobby that he or she must dress how you like. You can’t tell someone how to act. You certainly cannot force them to write you reports. You cannot monitor their Facebook. You can’t enforce things like the Magic Judge Code.

Imagine if your local game store required you to clean the bathroom. If you don’t clean the bathrooms, they will not let you play. Even better, if you do clean the bathrooms, you get to play for free. That store would be in violation of minimum wage laws. Cleaning bathrooms is work. If you are not paying minimum wage for that work, you are breaking the law. It doesn’t even matter if you really love cleaning bathrooms. The store owner cannot allow people to do work for less than minimum wage.

I will talk about the point of bringing up the law and the point of demanding a non-profit in other notes.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 14, 2020, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Apr 20, 2016, 9:06 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Catanese v. Wizards of the Coast</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>Sean Catanese was formerly a Level 4 Judge and Judge Regional Coordinator. He is currently  one of four Program Coordinators. The following is from his blog post “Applying a Lens of Clarity to the US Southeast Suspensions” which he posted on February 1st, 2016.

On December 18, I got a message from Aaron Hamer, the Interim Judge Community Manager, letting me know about the suspensions for all of the judges involved. There were no details about leaks or cards, and no indication that more details would be forthcoming. Wizards’ generally doesn’t share its internal investigation documents, and the JCC is no exception. 

We don’t oversee them in any fashion. We abide by their decisions because they’re not decisions that we’re empowered to remake or question. There’s a fundamental dependency of the Judge Program on Wizards, and that’s not something I was (or am) capable of changing in that moment or any other. Ultimately, Magic is Wizards’ game and Wizards’ property, simple as that.

Apparently, Wizards of the Coast has not informed its attorneys. This passage is from a February 23, 2016 filing by Wizards of the Coast in a class action suit filed on behalf of Judges. It is publicly available from the North District Court of California, Yale vs. Wizards of the Coast. (I have no relation with this current case other than avid interest.)

Indeed, Plaintiff has not, and cannot allege facts that support his conclusory and unfounded assertions that Wizards had or has the authority to hire, fire, supervise, or otherwise control Plaintiff and the multitude of individuals that he seeks to represent.

It has been happening more and more. People are getting caught up in hyper-partisan, visceral and shrill politics. The sexuality debates are causing the type of violence and division that seemed to be in our past. It is hurting real people. But it is not just about sexuality. It is about a lot of things. People are being shrill. Our political discussions have become Internet flame-wars. As that happens more, the more sensible people are bowing out of the conversation. The feedback loop just makes things worse and worse.
 
Of course, it is sensible to stay out of these flame-wars. If anyone ever changed anybody&#039;s mind by arguing online, it is likely that other sensible methods would be less effort and more rewarding. Plenty of wise people know enough to not discuss sex, religion or politics. More often than not, the mere discussion contributes to more hurt feelings and misunderstandings. Add to that the fact that these opinions become part of your &quot;permanent record&quot; on the Internet. The moderate person has every reason to stay away. The people who do speak tend to be the most loud, most extreme and those who enjoy arguing the most. It is unfortunate, but sensible people are pushed out of the conversation.
 
This is beyond unfortunate and it is harmful. It is destructive of the fabric of our society. It is distortive of our politics. It leads to demagoguery of the worst sort. It dooms much of our legislative process to silly bickering. It casts a shadow on our courts and what should be non-partisan civil service. Views on abortion are not a valid political consideration when selecting members talking about trash service and air quality. Allowing only judges who believe life begins at birth to sit on the bench is no way to guarantee business contracts are properly enforced.
 
The conversation online does impact our lives. It impacts our lives in that it drives all the news, including offline news. It impacts our lives because online can no longer be contrasted with &quot;irl&quot; (in real life) as starkly as it was in the days of Usenet and IRC. Social media carries with it the importance of identity and real life relationships. Online consensus leads to offline action. The conversation is being hijacked by the least sensible of our society and it is only being met with the clamour of other shrill voices. I plead guilty to being a shrill voice, so I am asking the sensible to please start talking some sense.
 
This USA Today article really emphasizes the tragedy of what we are experiencing today.
 
&quot;You look at something and you project onto it your feelings and, in some cases, fears,&quot; said Curt Smith, president of the Indiana Family Institute.
 
In Arizona last year, the discourse became so polarizing that then-Gov. Jan Brewer — also a Republican — vetoed a similar religious freedom proposal.
 
&quot;It could divide Arizona in ways we cannot even imagine,&quot; she said, &quot;and no one would ever want.&quot;
 
In Indiana, fear-fueled misconceptions helped garner support for the law and pitted others so vehemently against it. The rhetorical hyperbole — perhaps more so than the law itself — has galvanized two constituencies while further dividing Indiana.
And it raises another question: Will the political maneuvering on both sides continue to obscure people&#039;s understanding of the practical effects of the law?
 
If that happens, it begins to matter less what the law actually does than what people &quot;think&quot; it allows them to do — whether that is to openly discriminate against gay people or unfairly cast all Christians as intolerant.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/29/religious-freedom-law-really-means-indiana/70633532/
 
This has been true of many other situations. As someone who works in the insurance business, I see the daily impact that our hyperpartisan culture has on real people. I have to give my clients news that brings tears to their eyes. Instead of trying to blame Obama or the Republicans; we need to have actual action to truly improve the situation. I will let you in on a little secret I have been screaming from the rafters. The vast majority of the day to day effects of the Affordable Care Act and healthcare reform have nothing to do whatsoever with anything that is being discussed in the news or by the politicians. People speak about them with such mountains of ignorance that it is difficult to educate them. This includes highly educated people who try very hard to be knowledgeable. The problem is that the conversation is so shrill, it has become impossible to pick out the real from the unreal.
 
I  am consistently talking to people who are arguing the precise opposite of what they believe because their tribe has espoused it. No matter how laissez faire capitalist a proposal to improve Obamacare is, people on the Right have to be against it. No matter command economy socialist a proposal to replace Obamacare is, people on the Left have to be against it.
 
The Affordable Care Act would have never passed if our politicians knew what was in it. There are many right wing components that Democrats could never have supported. Components that shift away from unions, government and regulation towards free market principle. Components that Democrats actively oppose, but defend regarding Obamacare, because they don&#039;t realize are part of the ACA. Components that conservative Republicans would love to pass, but are seeking to repeal just because it is affiliated with Obamacare.
 
The uproar over the religious freedom law slices lines further through Indiana at a time when the spotlight is hot on the state.
&quot;There&#039;s some hyperbole on both sides,&quot; said Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, &quot;but it&#039;s a genuine fear.&quot;
 
That is just not acceptable. When you speak in hyperbole, you lose credibility. At least, you should lose credibility. People should be willing to call you on ridiculous statements that you make and challenge you when you engage in vitriol. Ranting, venting and motivating is no excuse.
 
I implore the sensible people to make a simple pledge. Please, help to tone it down. You don&#039;t have to argue. You don&#039;t have to engage. Just simply comment something like &quot;I would prefer a calmer discussion&quot; or &quot;I think this issue has been overpoliticized.&quot; Be visible. Be there.
 
I believe that there are several points at which a discussion goes too far and becomes destructive. I think it is important to make sure that we keep people on our side of the fence honest. Not by evenhanded condemnation of both sides or surrendering to the horrible state that exists. We need to challenge people who say things that are beyond the pale. Even though I was never a McCain supporter, I was impressed when he stopped one of his supporters from claiming President Obama is a Muslim. You may not agree with me and that is fine. All I ask is that you take the time to voice your concern when things go beyond what you accept as tolerable.
 
1) Criminalizing political difference is beyond the pale. If someone starts talking about crimes in relation to politics, they have gone too far. Crimes are not a matter of opinion. Our legal system has two very basic components of a crime: mens rea and actus reas. Mens rea requires that the person who commits the crime know that it is a crime. A person who believes they are doing the right thing by their actions may be insane, but they are not criminals. Any talk of a crime being committed by someone who believes they are doing what is right is beyond the pale. It has lost touch with how crimes are defined in our society. Actus reas requires that the person who commits the crime actually perform an action. We reject the idea of thought crime. There must be an act that is criminal in order to constitute a cime. Any talk of a crime being committed by someone who hasn&#039;t actually done anything is beyond the pale. 
 
2) Engaging in hyperbole is beyond the pale. It doesn&#039;t matter if you have very legitimate reasons for wanting to win the argument. Intellectual honesty is a key component of productive dialogue. Anyone who starts to speak in exaggerations has stepped beyond the pale. I have often cite my experience of hearing someone from People for the American Way say that she thought it was possible that the State of California would pass laws banning abortion. I understand that in some ludicrous way, she justified that statement in her mind in order to prevent complacency by California citizens. But anyone who actually believes such a law would pass in California has lost contact with reality. Making such statements is beyond the pale. Anyone who makes such statements has forfeited the right to be taken seriously.
 
3) Fear tactics are beyond the pale. We all have fears and we are all somewhat motivated by our fears. I admit that the cavalier attitude towards gun control by so many on the Left inspires a level of fear in me. I believe the Second Amendment to be an important safeguard of my liberty and personal safety. It is an issue that I feel strongly about. An appeal to fear is no way to conduct a reasoned discourse. Crying that the sky is falling on a constant basis has been a persistent problem in politics. It continues to be so. Trying to scare people is beyond the pale. Warning people, pointing to actual dangers, and advocating for a solution is great. Trying to emotionally instill fear in people is an assault on the intellect and the person. It is a political tool that causes unneeded and unproductive distrust between members of our society. It destroys communities and destroys the people who get caught up in those fears.
 
4) Lying is beyond the pale. Those who lie in discourse forfeit the right to be taken seriously. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Nobody is entitled to a different version of the facts. If we are to agree or even agree to disagree, there must be the exchange of information. When you corrupt our collective understanding of the situation by inserting fiction, you poison the collective well from which we all drink. Misrepresenting the truth is beyond the pale.
 
5) Tribalism is beyond the pale. I once witnessed a remarkable moment of candor. Susan Estrich said that she and other feminists were relieved when Clinton finally left office because they &quot;no longer had to excuse to inexcusable.&quot; It doesn&#039;t matter if you love Bill Clinton or hate Bill Clinton. It doesn&#039;t matter if you loved his politics or hated his politics. We can never fall into the trap of excusing the inexcusable. That form of hyperpartisanship only leads to further tit for tat retaliations and unchecked misbehavior. We must be willing to see the faults of our own side of an issue if we are to make any progress. That which is inexcusable in one tribe is inexcusable in any other tribe. Hypocrisy and favoritism go beyond the pale.
 
If you agree with any of what I said, I ask you to please make a pledge to help tone down the discussion around us. Even if it is just something simple, please voice your objection. If the sensible people are silent, then the echoes of insanity will carry much further.

A friend of mine asked me to respond to this article from the NYT. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/world/middleeast/fighting-political-islam-arab-states-find-themselves-allied-with-israel.html
 
This was my response:
 
This quote basically sums up my &quot;vast majority of Muslims are human beings&quot; disconnect with the majority of conventional wisdom in the West regarding the Middle East:
 
The dynamic has inverted all expectations of the Arab Spring uprisings. As recently as 18 months ago, most analysts in Israel, Washington and the Palestinian territories expected the popular uprisings to make the Arab governments more responsive to their citizens, and therefore more sympathetic to the Palestinians and more hostile to Israel.
 
But instead of becoming more isolated, Israel’s government has emerged for the moment as an unexpected beneficiary of the ensuing tumult, now tacitly supported by the leaders of the resurgent conservative order as an ally in their common fight against political Islam.
 
The assumption is that Arab citizens are idiots who don&#039;t realize what would suck for them, like being beheaded at random by insane zealots. It certainly has not inverted my expectations of the Arab Spring uprisings. The Arab governments now have to think about what sponsoring terrorism in Israel means to them at home.
 
While I am no fan of al-Sisi in any way, describing the resurgence of the military in Egypt as purely military coup is ignorant. It was broadly supported by important leaders such as Pope Tawadros II and the Imam al Azhar. Egyptian citizens did not want rulers more concerned with shutting down rock concerts than making sure the trains don&#039;t crash into each other. (Those are real examples of shit that happened under Brotherhood rule and caused outrage within Egypt.)
 
I have long believed that a more responsive Arab leadership will lead to less anti-semitism, less hatred of the West, less determination to stamp out any sign of democratic rule and less Islamic fundamentalism. Does Iran have a horrible government? Sure. Is Iran the only place outside of Israel with a sizable Jewish and Zoroastrian community? Yes. Notice the Zoroastrians, who are dismissed by Muslim fundamentalists as outright idolaters and referred to as &quot;fire worshippers.&quot;
 
Muslims are human beings. That means they don&#039;t want to die. They don&#039;t want their children to die. They don&#039;t want to live in poverty. They don&#039;t want their natural freedoms violated. They don&#039;t want to be in constant war.
 
This is what gets me so upset with bigots saying shit like democracy doesn&#039;t work &quot;in a country with ethnicities that hate each other and don&#039;t believe in democracy or rights.&quot; We don&#039;t have ethnicities that hate each other? Arabs don&#039;t believe in democracy or rights? Just replace Arabs with blacks and these are arguments straight out of the KKK and apartheid.
 
The article frames the differences between Saudi Arabia and Qatar in terms of Islamic fervor. That is demonstrably false. http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/07/10/most-muslims-want-democracy-personal-freedoms-and-islam-in-political-life/ Look at the position of Turkey on those charts. It flies in the face of everything this reporter claims about the country.
 
The difference between the positions of Qatar and Saudi Arabia is proximity. Qatar isn&#039;t next door neighbors to Hamas. The popularity of Turkey and Qatar during the Arab Spring was based on the standard of living of their civilian population, not Islamism.

1) I have amicably resolved all disputes with Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro.
 
2) Anybody who has been a judge in the past 5 years or received damaged cards should make sure they receive any cards due to them.
 
3) If you want me to sign any cards, feel free to send them in the packaging you want them returned in with appropriate postage.
 
4) If you think I am a horrible person, please feel free to send anything you feel you don&#039;t deserve to keep to David Vogin.

It is one of the most important things to religious Jews and Christians living today. The Dead Sea Scrolls have been discovered. This is important. It is very important. Which is why I want to write this all down as a reference for anyone who wants to know.

The question of what is the “actual” text of the Bible is obviously important. Billions of people live their lives in accordance to their understanding of the Bible. So what is exactly in that Bible is very important. Different denominations of Christians even have different books which they include or exclude from the Bible. There have been important and consequential disagreements when it comes to individual sentences, words and even letters.

For centuries, Christian scholars have downplayed the Masoretic Text, the traditional text of the Hebrew maintained by the Jewish communities. There have been all manner of accusations, including that the Rabbis have deliberately altered the text. The antisemitism in the accusation is obvious. Supposedly, the people who devote their whole lives to following Judaism even to the point of torture and death, were willing to alter the Bible itself. Why such a person wouldn’t take the opportunity to convert to Christianity or Islam and live a far more comfortable life is beyond any reasonable person’s credulity. Yet the charges have been leveled.

I am not going to cite any sources. Everything I say can be verified by a simple Google search. That way, you can use whatever source you trust and I will not be playing an eternal game of whack-a-mole with what are easily verifiable facts. Just search Google, there are plenty of sites from sources you yourself feel comfortable with whether academic or religious.

The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered by a gentile. They were handed over to a scholar who was a vicious antisemite and would not let any Jews near them. Which is why it took decades until they were finally photographed and made available to the whole world. They were from a sect which were not, unlike modern Jews, Pharisees. There is no possibility of Pharisaic collusion with the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The Dead Sea Scrolls include a full copy of the Torah, the Book of Isaiah and the Book of Psalms. The differences are so minor that they are not worth even bothering with. If you prefer the Dead Sea Scroll text over the Masoretic Text, go ahead. I don’t see any point whatsoever in even arguing about it. Pick the Dead Sea Scroll text you like and go with it.

Yet, there are people intent on still maligning the Masoretic Text. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that there are still people around who are trying to credibly claim that the Masoretic Text is “significantly” different or has been corrupted or some other silly thing. Let me dispense with the silliness.

First and foremost, the texts that are actually significant are only the Five Books of Moses, the Psalms and Isaiah. All of the Laws in Judaism are derived from the Five Books of Moses. None of the verses at issue change anything at the core of Judaism whatsoever. We only read the Five Books of Moses from an actual scroll in the synagogue. Talking about any of the other books of the Bible and then casting aspersions on the Masoretic text is simply dishonest. Judaism is based on what Moshe Rabbeinu taught us.

The Book of Isaiah and the Book of Psalms are at issue because Christian texts quote extensively from them. Now, honestly, I think the issue is actually moot. Not one of those texts would change Judaism one iota nor one jot. Maybe they make a difference for Christians, but they don’t change anything for Jews.

It was not merely a presentation of things that the two had decided on or a discussion of views one of them had already explored. It was two of the most intelligent, well read and thoughtful people on the planet speaking about the most important problems we have today.

People familiar with the Intellectual Dark Web will not be completely new to the view of reality that forms the environment in which this discussion was had. People who are used to the mainstream narrative will be completely lost. The world Weinstein and Thiel describe does not resemble the world CNN or Fox News reports on. It is, however, a far more accurate view of the world.

They are describing reality as it exists, not the narrative. While I do not have the raw economic data to document their assumptions, I feel confident that Weinstein and Thiel have more accurate data than anyone else. Weinstein is a mathematician who manages Thiel Capital, his wife is an accomplished economist and Peter Thiel is a self-made billionaire.

One of Weinstein’s signature ideas is the Embedded Growth Obligation (EGO). An EGO is a characteristic of certain organizations. For example, a law firm has an EGO. When lawyers join a firm, they do so in the hope of one day becoming a partner in the firm. Thus, the firm must constantly grow in order to accommodate the obligations it has to the junior associates. If the firm fails to provide a path of upward mobility, it will fail to attract the best legal talent. If you want the smarter young attorneys to work as junior associates, you must provide them a path to becoming partner.

I believe Weinstein speaks of the EGO because he fears to put it as clearly as he could. A law firm is a Multi-Level Marketing or a more sophisticated Ponzi scheme. The partners earn the big bucks by recruiting young lawyers to “pay their dues” in their firm with the dishonest promise of a partnership.

Academia suffers from the same problem. How many people earn a Ph.D. every year? How many faculty positions exist for all these Ph.D.s? Considering how rare it is for a Ph.D. program to fail one of its students, the pipeline is constantly churning out far more supply than there is demand for people with doctorates.

Weinstein and Thiel are confident, and I must agree, that student debt problem is one of the most important problems burdening our society. Young people are deceived by all the most powerful institutions in our society to rack up huge debts which cannot be discharged in bankruptcy to obtain degrees which are unlikely to assist them in their futures. I was delighted to hear Thiel propose the idea which I think makes the most sense. Make the loans dischargeable in bankruptcy and make the universities liable for at least a portion of the cancelled debt.

The problem is more fundamental than merely the student loan debt, however. The problem is that our sense making organs are not functioning. Our institutions are dishonest. The mainstream narrative is a lie and enough people know that it is a lie that the edifice must crumble. Thiel expressed surprise that it has yet to crumble and a belief that it must crumble within decades at most.

Will it?</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Jul 20, 2019, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Jul 20, 2019, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Bullshit!</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>I got into a Facebook fight with a friend today, which ended with me defriending him and with him blocking me. Which is always a source of reflection for me. I think as a general rule, nobody is 100% right and nobody 100% wrong. But the fact is that the more I think about it, the more I think that the trouble was simply that I was speaking truthfully about a subject that he was speaking about irresponsibly.

He posted a link to an article that is completely fact-free claiming that “the data” shows the Affordable Care Act caused premiums to go up. Except it offered no data at all. It has a statement regarding unknown analysis which supposedly show things. Without any data whatsoever. None. “These findings come from new data from eHealth.” The link leads to a website’s page where you can buy insurance. No study. No data. Nothing. You might as well click on an advertisement. It has a chart with supposed “computations by HSI, LLC.” 

My friend told me that instead of personal attacks, I should refute the data. Which is usually a very reasonable assertion. If there is data. There is no data here. This is pure garbage masquerading around as analysis. It is an embarrassment to the people who wrote it, the organizations they are affiliated with, the website that published it and anyone who links to it.

I was even more charitable than I needed to be. I tried looking through the website, looked up the authors of the article and tried to find if they published their actual analysis without citing it. Nope. Nothing. There is no there there. What “findings,” what “computations” and what “new data”?!? It is CliffsNotes version of a book that has not been written.

Now, if they HAD provided their data, I am sure I would have ripped it to shreds. Mostly because there can be no “new data” since all the data is already available. It has been for a while. Which is why I have a standing challenge to anyone to come up with any quantitative analysis which shows the situation before Obamacare was better than the situation after Obamacare. It doesn’t exist because it isn’t true. 

You can no more show that than you can show the Earth is flat or that global temperatures have fallen. You can have all kinds of arguments about why global temperatures are rising. You can debate what to do about temperatures rising. You can even debate whether it is good for the temperatures to rise. Nobody who knows anything about it, however, says that the temperatures are not rising. Not the environmentalists and not the skeptics. Nobody.

The same is true of the ACA. Healthcare and health insurance in the United States cost less now than they did before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. You can’t deny that fact because the data is readily available. It has been widely analyzed and the analysis is clear. Which is why nobody refutes it. The Heritage Foundation and CATO institute have been chomping at the bit to criticize Obamacare in every which way. They haven’t published anything because you can’t publish anything because it isn’t true.

I am used to dealing with people misstating the case regarding the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). I am regularly correcting deeply flawed analyses, mostly by amateurs who don’t understand that “healthcare could be so complicated.” The CNN debate on healthcare between Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Bernie Sanders pretty much had me in conniptions. I tried responding but found that I was spending pages just clarifying why individual sentences were misleading.

I feel like saying “it is misleading and your eyes will glaze over if I start to explain why.” I still go ahead and show them why they are wrong, if they are willing to go through all that drudgery. Most people are not and prefer to be ignorant. It is something we have established firmly in our society repeatedly.

What do I do when there isn’t even misleading analysis? Am I supposed to make up some bullshit analysis for these people in order to refute it? This is complete and utter bullshit!

Don’t the people who act so irresponsibly need to be confronted? Should I stop calling bullshit what it is? Have we gotten to a point where we have to put up with a fact-free society? Personal attacks are justified, if the person is doing something that needs to be attacked.

I also have to say that I don’t think it is possible to attack this type of bullshit by being nice about it. Respectful debate has its limitations. There can be no respectful debate when one side is operating on pure bullshit. I can’t refute assertions that are untrue without pointing out that they are false and that the people asserting them are liars. You have to call bullshit what it is or simply give up. Which I refuse to do.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 18, 2020, 8:14 PM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Mar 10, 2018, 2:08 PM</div></div></div></div><div class="_4t5o"><div>Generated by ‎יעקב פטורהצ&#039;י‎ on Thursday, May 6, 2021 at 9:13 AM UTC-07:00</div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
